Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of\nthe U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company\'s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is a risk that the Company will have to\nadjust local currency pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.\nThe Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with\ncertain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. In addition,\nthe Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into foreign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses on its\nforeign currency-denominated debt issuances. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue\nand inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of\nreasons including, but not limited to, accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 26\nTo provide an assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with\n\n\n--- Chunk 4 (Relevance: 0.47) ---\n[Document: APPLE_2021_10K.pdf] [Chunk ID: 2e100688e1f563e9]\n[Page: None] [Source URL: http://47.128.228.192/chunk/parsed/chunks?id=917005d4e6f711f0baea9af0fe87e5d6&doc_id=0fb7ce83e6f911f0ba989af0fe87e5d6&page=1]\n| Americas: |  | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 |\n| Net sales | $ | 153,306$ | 124,556$ 37,722 $ | 116,914 35,099 |\n| Operatingincome | $ | 53,382$ |  |  |\n| Europe: |  |  |  |  |\n| Net sales | $ | 89,307$ | 68,640$ | 60,288 |\n| Operating income | $ | 32,505$ | 22,170$ | 19,195 |\n| GreaterChina: |  |  |  |  |\n| Net sales |  | 68,366 | 40,308 | 43,678 |\n| Operating income |  | 28,504 | 15,261 | 16,232 |\n| Japan: |  |  |  |  |\n| Net sales | $ | 28,482 | 21,418 $ | 21,506 |\n| Operating income |  | 12,798 $ | 9,279 $ | 9,369 |\n| Rest of Asia Pacific: |  |  |  |  |\n| Net sales | $ | 26,356$ | 19,593 $ | 17,788 |\n| Operating income | $ | 9,817 $ | 6,808 $ | 6,055 |\n| A reconciliation of the Company\'s segment operating income to the Consolidated Statements of Operations for 2021, 2020 and 2019 is as follows (in millions): | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 |  |\n| Segment operating income | $ | 137,006 $ | 91,240 $ | 85,950 |\n| Research and development expense |  | (21,914) | (18,752) | (16,217) |\n| Other corporate expenses,net |  | (6,143) | (6,200) | (5,803) |\n| Total operating income  Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 50 | $ | 108,949 $ | 66,288 $ | 63,930 |\n\n\n--- Chunk 5 (Relevance: 0.44) ---\n[Document: APPLE_2021_10K.pdf] [Chunk ID: 2335c96e6f7562d0]\n[Page: None] [Source URL: http://47.128.228.192/chunk/parsed/chunks?id=917005d4e6f711f0baea9af0fe87e5d6&doc_id=0fb7ce83e6f911f0ba989af0fe87e5d6&page=1]\nFinancialRisks\nThe Company expects its quarterly net sales and results of operations to fluctuate.\nThe Company\'s profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For example, the gross margins on the\nCompany\'s products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The Company\'s gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure\ndue to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in\nresponse to such pressures; increased competition; the Company\'s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed\nproduct life cycles; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering content for the\nCompany\'s services; the Company\'s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the\ngeographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that regulatory changes require the Company to modify its product and service offerings;\nfluctuations in foreign exchange rates; and the introduction of new products or services, including new products or services with higher cost structures.

In addition, the Company\'s\nglobal supply chain is large and complex and a majority of the Company\'s supplier facilities, including manufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the\nU.S. As a result, the Company\'s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions.\nAdverse macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, slower growth or recession, new or increased tariffs and other barriers to trade, changes to fiscal and\nmonetary policy, tighter credit, higher interest rates, high unemployment and currency fluctuations can materially adversely affect demand for the Company\'s\nproducts and services. In addition, consumer confidence and spending can be adversely affected in response to financial market volatility, negative financial\nnews, conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets, declines in income or asset values, changes to fuel and other energy costs, labor and healthcare\ncosts andother economicfactors.\nApple Inc.| 2021 Form 10-K | 6\nIn addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company\'s products, uncertainty about, or a dec\n\n\n--- Chunk 2 (Relevance: 0.45) ---\n[Document: APPLE_2021_10K.pdf] [Chunk ID: 149ffd2d7519f2da]\n[Page: None] [Source URL: http://47.128.228.192/chunk/parsed/chunks?id=917005d4e6f711f0baea9af0fe87e5d6&doc_id=0fb7ce83e6f911f0ba989af0fe87e5d6&page=1]\nApple Inc.\nForm 10-K\nFortheFiscalYearEndedSeptember25,2021\nTABLEOFCONTENTS\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K ("Form 10-K") contains forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995,\nthat involve risks and uncertainties. Many of the forward-looking statements are located in Part Il, Item 7 of this Form 10-K under the heading “Management\'s\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on\ncertain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example, statements in this Form 10-K regarding\nthe potential future impact of the COviD-19 pandemic on the Company\'s business and results of operations are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking\nstatements can also be identified by words such as “future,” “anticipates,” “believes,”"“estimates,”" “expects," "intends,”“plans,""predicts,”" “"will,” “"would," “could,"\n"can,”"“may," and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company\'s actual results may differ significantly\nfrom the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I,\nItem 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors."

The CoviD-19\npandemic has at times significantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets. The COviD-19\npandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have affected and could in the future materially impact the Company\'s business, results of\noperations and financial condition, as well as the price of the Company\'s stock.\nDuring 2021, aspects of the Company\'s business continued to be affected by the COviD-19 pandemic, with many of the Company\'s retail stores, as well as\nchannel partner points of sale, temporarily closed at various times, and a significant number of the Company\'s employees working remotely. The Company has\nreopened all of its retail stores and substantially all of its other facilities, subject to operating restrictions to protect public health and the health and safety of\nemployees and customers, and it continues to work on safely reopening the remainder of its facilities, subject to local rules and regulations.

The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company\nreviews long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers\' facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances\nindicate the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which\nthe carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and\npurchase commitments are currently recoverable, there can be no assurance the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other charges\ngiven the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes.\nThe Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. Manufacturing purchase\nobligations cover the Company\'s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for periods up to 150 days. Because the Company\'s markets\nare volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or\ninsu\n\n\n--- Chunk 5 (Relevance: 0.41) ---\n[Document: APPLE_2021_10K.pdf] [Chunk ID: 0d304c43efcb80f1]\n[Page: None] [Source URL: http://47.128.228.192/chunk/parsed/chunks?id=917005d4e6f711f0baea9af0fe87e5d6&doc_id=0fb7ce83e6f911f0ba989af0fe87e5d6&page=1]\nandservices.\nDue to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the Company competes, the Company must continually introduce new products,\nservices and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services, and\nsuccessfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services. The success of new product and service introductions depends on a\nnumber of factors, including timely and successful development, market acceptance, the Company\'s ability to manage the risks associated with production\nramp-up issues, the availability of application software for the Company\'s products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in\nline with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that\nnew products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies. There can be no assurance the Company will successfully manage future\nintroductions and transitions of products and services.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 8\nThe Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of which are\n\n\n=== CRITICAL AUDIT PROTOCOLS ===\n\n**1.

Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of\nthe U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company\'s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is a risk that the Company will have to\nadjust local currency pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.\nThe Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with\ncertain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. In addition,\nthe Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into foreign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses on its\nforeign currency-denominated debt issuances. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue\nand inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of\nreasons including, but not limited to, accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 26\nTo provide an assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with\n\n\n--- Chunk 4 (Relevance: 0.43) ---\n[Document: APPLE_2021_10K.pdf] [Chunk ID: 2e100688e1f563e9]\n[Page: None] [Source URL: http://47.128.228.192/chunk/parsed/chunks?id=917005d4e6f711f0baea9af0fe87e5d6&doc_id=0fb7ce83e6f911f0ba989af0fe87e5d6&page=1]\n| Americas: |  | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 |\n| Net sales | $ | 153,306$ | 124,556$ 37,722 $ | 116,914 35,099 |\n| Operatingincome | $ | 53,382$ |  |  |\n| Europe: |  |  |  |  |\n| Net sales | $ | 89,307$ | 68,640$ | 60,288 |\n| Operating income | $ | 32,505$ | 22,170$ | 19,195 |\n| GreaterChina: |  |  |  |  |\n| Net sales |  | 68,366 | 40,308 | 43,678 |\n| Operating income |  | 28,504 | 15,261 | 16,232 |\n| Japan: |  |  |  |  |\n| Net sales | $ | 28,482 | 21,418 $ | 21,506 |\n| Operating income |  | 12,798 $ | 9,279 $ | 9,369 |\n| Rest of Asia Pacific: |  |  |  |  |\n| Net sales | $ | 26,356$ | 19,593 $ | 17,788 |\n| Operating income | $ | 9,817 $ | 6,808 $ | 6,055 |\n| A reconciliation of the Company\'s segment operating income to the Consolidated Statements of Operations for 2021, 2020 and 2019 is as follows (in millions): | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 |  |\n| Segment operating income | $ | 137,006 $ | 91,240 $ | 85,950 |\n| Research and development expense |  | (21,914) | (18,752) | (16,217) |\n| Other corporate expenses,net |  | (6,143) | (6,200) | (5,803) |\n| Total operating income  Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 50 | $ | 108,949 $ | 66,288 $ | 63,930 |\n\n\n--- Chunk 5 (Relevance: 0.43) ---\n[Document: APPLE_2021_10K.pdf] [Chunk ID: 2335c96e6f7562d0]\n[Page: None] [Source URL: http://47.128.228.192/chunk/parsed/chunks?id=917005d4e6f711f0baea9af0fe87e5d6&doc_id=0fb7ce83e6f911f0ba989af0fe87e5d6&page=1]\nFinancialRisks\nThe Company expects its quarterly net sales and results of operations to fluctuate.\nThe Company\'s profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For example, the gross margins on the\nCompany\'s products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The Company\'s gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure\ndue to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in\nresponse to such pressures; increased competition; the Company\'s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed\nproduct life cycles; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering content for the\nCompany\'s services; the Company\'s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the\ngeographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that regulatory changes require the Company to modify its product and service offerings;\nfluctuations in foreign exchange rates; and the introduction of new products or services, including new products or services with higher cost structures.

In addition, the Company\'s\nglobal supply chain is large and complex and a majority of the Company\'s supplier facilities, including manufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the\nU.S. As a result, the Company\'s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions.\nAdverse macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, slower growth or recession, new or increased tariffs and other barriers to trade, changes to fiscal and\nmonetary policy, tighter credit, higher interest rates, high unemployment and currency fluctuations can materially adversely affect demand for the Company\'s\nproducts and services. In addition, consumer confidence and spending can be adversely affected in response to financial market volatility, negative financial\nnews, conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets, declines in income or asset values, changes to fuel and other energy costs, labor and healthcare\ncosts andother economicfactors.\nApple Inc.| 2021 Form 10-K | 6\nIn addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company\'s products, uncertainty about, or a dec\n\n\n--- Chunk 2 (Relevance: 0.45) ---\n[Document: APPLE_2021_10K.pdf] [Chunk ID: 149ffd2d7519f2da]\n[Page: None] [Source URL: http://47.128.228.192/chunk/parsed/chunks?id=917005d4e6f711f0baea9af0fe87e5d6&doc_id=0fb7ce83e6f911f0ba989af0fe87e5d6&page=1]\nApple Inc.\nForm 10-K\nFortheFiscalYearEndedSeptember25,2021\nTABLEOFCONTENTS\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K ("Form 10-K") contains forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995,\nthat involve risks and uncertainties. Many of the forward-looking statements are located in Part Il, Item 7 of this Form 10-K under the heading “Management\'s\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on\ncertain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example, statements in this Form 10-K regarding\nthe potential future impact of the COviD-19 pandemic on the Company\'s business and results of operations are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking\nstatements can also be identified by words such as “future,” “anticipates,” “believes,”"“estimates,”" “expects," "intends,”“plans,""predicts,”" “"will,” “"would," “could,"\n"can,”"“may," and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company\'s actual results may differ significantly\nfrom the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I,\nItem 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors."

The CoviD-19\npandemic has at times significantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets. The COviD-19\npandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have affected and could in the future materially impact the Company\'s business, results of\noperations and financial condition, as well as the price of the Company\'s stock.\nDuring 2021, aspects of the Company\'s business continued to be affected by the COviD-19 pandemic, with many of the Company\'s retail stores, as well as\nchannel partner points of sale, temporarily closed at various times, and a significant number of the Company\'s employees working remotely. The Company has\nreopened all of its retail stores and substantially all of its other facilities, subject to operating restrictions to protect public health and the health and safety of\nemployees and customers, and it continues to work on safely reopening the remainder of its facilities, subject to local rules and regulations. During the fourth\nquarter of 2021, certain of the Company\'s component suppliers and logistical service providers experienced disruptions, res\n\n\n--- Chunk 4 (Relevance: 0.41) ---\n[Document: APPLE_2021_10K.pdf] [Chunk ID: 056d15853d3eee38]\n[Page: None] [Source URL: http://47.128.228.192/chunk/parsed/chunks?id=917005d4e6f711f0baea9af0fe87e5d6&doc_id=0fb7ce83e6f911f0ba989af0fe87e5d6&page=1]\nrisk.\nThe Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand, or for which cost\nexceeds net realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company\nreviews long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers\' facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances\nindicate the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which\nthe carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and\npurchase commitments are currently recoverable, there can be no assurance the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other charges\ngiven the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes.\nThe Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. Manufacturing purchase\nobligations cover the Company\'s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for periods up to 150 days. Because the Company\'s markets\nare volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or\ninsu\n\n\n--- Chunk 5 (Relevance: 0.41) ---\n[Document: APPLE_2021_10K.pdf] [Chunk ID: 0d304c43efcb80f1]\n[Page: None] [Source URL: http://47.128.228.192/chunk/parsed/chunks?id=917005d4e6f711f0baea9af0fe87e5d6&doc_id=0fb7ce83e6f911f0ba989af0fe87e5d6&page=1]\nandservices.\nDue to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the Company competes, the Company must continually introduce new products,\nservices and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services, and\nsuccessfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services. The success of new product and service introductions depends on a\nnumber of factors, including timely and successful development, market acceptance, the Company\'s ability to manage the risks associated with production\nramp-up issues, the availability of application software for the Company\'s products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in\nline with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that\nnew products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies. There can be no assurance the Company will successfully manage future\nintroductions and transitions of products and services.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 8\nThe Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of which are\n\n\n=== CRITICAL AUDIT PROTOCOLS ===\n\n**1.

As a\nresult, management must make numerous assumptions, which involve a significant amount of judgment, when performing recoverability and impairment tests of current and\nnoncurent assets in various regions around the world.\nWe perform recoverability and impairment tests of current and noncurrent assets in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For certain assets, recoverability and/or impairment tests are\nrequired only when conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. For other assets, impairment tests are required at least annually, or more frequently\nif events or circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired.\nThe performance of recoverability and impairment tests of current and noncurrent assets involves critical accounting estimates. These estimates require significant management\njudgment, include inherent uncertainties and are often interdependent; therefore, they do not change in isolation. Factors that management must estimate include, among others,\nthe economic lives of the assets, sales volume, pricing, royalty rates, cost of raw materials, delivery costs, the impact of \n\n\n--- Chunk 4 (Relevance: 0.37) ---\n[Document: COCACOLA_2022_10K.pdf] [Chunk ID: f842014cd3b13aa9]\n[Page: None] [Source URL: http://47.128.228.192/chunk/parsed/chunks?id=917005d4e6f711f0baea9af0fe87e5d6&doc_id=137bd635e6f911f09f8f9af0fe87e5d6&page=1]\nEffective tax rate\nIncludes net tax charges of $375 million (or a 3.0 percent impact on our effective tax rate) related to changes in tax laws in certain foreign jurisdictions, amounts required to be recorded for\nchanges to our uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties, in various international jurisdictions, as well as other discrete items\n2Includes a taxbenefit of $14 million (or a 1.5 percent impact on our effectiv tax rate) asociated withthe $834 milion gain recorded upon the acquisition of the remaining ownership interest in\nBodyArmor.

Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of\nthe U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company\'s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is a risk that the Company will have to\nadjust local currency pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.\nThe Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with\ncertain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. In addition,\nthe Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into foreign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses on its\nforeign currency-denominated debt issuances. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue\nand inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of\nreasons including, but not limited to, accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 26\nTo provide an assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with\n\n\n--- Chunk 4 (Relevance: 0.43) ---\n[Document: APPLE_2021_10K.pdf] [Chunk ID: 2e100688e1f563e9]\n[Page: None] [Source URL: http://13.250.126.161/chunk/parsed/chunks?id=917005d4e6f711f0baea9af0fe87e5d6&doc_id=0fb7ce83e6f911f0ba989af0fe87e5d6&page=1]\n| Americas: |  | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 |\n| Net sales | $ | 153,306$ | 124,556$ 37,722 $ | 116,914 35,099 |\n| Operatingincome | $ | 53,382$ |  |  |\n| Europe: |  |  |  |  |\n| Net sales | $ | 89,307$ | 68,640$ | 60,288 |\n| Operating income | $ | 32,505$ | 22,170$ | 19,195 |\n| GreaterChina: |  |  |  |  |\n| Net sales |  | 68,366 | 40,308 | 43,678 |\n| Operating income |  | 28,504 | 15,261 | 16,232 |\n| Japan: |  |  |  |  |\n| Net sales | $ | 28,482 | 21,418 $ | 21,506 |\n| Operating income |  | 12,798 $ | 9,279 $ | 9,369 |\n| Rest of Asia Pacific: |  |  |  |  |\n| Net sales | $ | 26,356$ | 19,593 $ | 17,788 |\n| Operating income | $ | 9,817 $ | 6,808 $ | 6,055 |\n| A reconciliation of the Company\'s segment operating income to the Consolidated Statements of Operations for 2021, 2020 and 2019 is as follows (in millions): | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 |  |\n| Segment operating income | $ | 137,006 $ | 91,240 $ | 85,950 |\n| Research and development expense |  | (21,914) | (18,752) | (16,217) |\n| Other corporate expenses,net |  | (6,143) | (6,200) | (5,803) |\n| Total operating income  Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 50 | $ | 108,949 $ | 66,288 $ | 63,930 |\n\n\n--- Chunk 5 (Relevance: 0.43) ---\n[Document: APPLE_2021_10K.pdf] [Chunk ID: 2335c96e6f7562d0]\n[Page: None] [Source URL: http://13.250.126.161/chunk/parsed/chunks?id=917005d4e6f711f0baea9af0fe87e5d6&doc_id=0fb7ce83e6f911f0ba989af0fe87e5d6&page=1]\nFinancialRisks\nThe Company expects its quarterly net sales and results of operations to fluctuate.\nThe Company\'s profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For example, the gross margins on the\nCompany\'s products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The Company\'s gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure\ndue to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in\nresponse to such pressures; increased competition; the Company\'s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed\nproduct life cycles; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering content for the\nCompany\'s services; the Company\'s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the\ngeographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that regulatory changes require the Company to modify its product and service offerings;\nfluctuations in foreign exchange rates; and the introduction of new products or services, including new products or services with higher cost structures.

Refer to the heading “Our Business — Challenges and Risks"” above and “Item 1A. Risk Factors" in Part I of this report. As a result,\nmanagement must make numerous assumptions, which involve a significant amount of judgment, when performing recoverability and impairment tests of current and\nnoncurrent assets in various regions around the world.\nWe perform recoverability and impairment tests of current and noncurrent assets in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For certain assets, recoverability and/or impairment tests are\nrequired only when conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. For other assets, impairment tests are required at least annually, or more frequently\nif events or circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired.\nThe performance of recoverability and impairment tests of current and noncurrent assets involves critical accounting estimates. These estimates require significant management\njudgment, include inherent uncertainties and are often interdependent; therefore, they do not change in isolation.

The CoviD-19\npandemic has at times significantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets. The COviD-19\npandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have affected and could in the future materially impact the Company\'s business, results of\noperations and financial condition, as well as the price of the Company\'s stock.\nDuring 2021, aspects of the Company\'s business continued to be affected by the COviD-19 pandemic, with many of the Company\'s retail stores, as well as\nchannel partner points of sale, temporarily closed at various times, and a significant number of the Company\'s employees working remotely. The Company has\nreopened all of its retail stores and substantially all of its other facilities, subject to operating restrictions to protect public health and the health and safety of\nemployees and customers, and it continues to work on safely reopening the remainder of its facilities, subject to local rules and regulations.

In addition, the Company\'s\nglobal supply chain is large and complex and a majority of the Company\'s supplier facilities, including manufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the\nU.S. As a result, the Company\'s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions.\nAdverse macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, slower growth or recession, new or increased tariffs and other barriers to trade, changes to fiscal and\nmonetary policy, tighter credit, higher interest rates, high unemployment and currency fluctuations can materially adversely affect demand for the Company\'s\nproducts and services. In addition, consumer confidence and spending can be adversely affected in response to financial market volatility, negative financial\nnews, conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets, declines in income or asset values, changes to fuel and other energy costs, labor and healthcare\ncosts andother economicfactors.\nApple Inc.| 2021 Form 10-K | 6\nIn addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company\'s products, uncertainty about, or a dec\n\n\n--- Chunk 5 (Relevance: 0.44) ---\n[Document: APPLE_2021_10K.pdf] [Chunk ID: 056d15853d3eee38]\n[Page: None] [Source URL: http://13.250.126.161/chunk/parsed/chunks?id=917005d4e6f711f0baea9af0fe87e5d6&doc_id=0fb7ce83e6f911f0ba989af0fe87e5d6&page=1]\nrisk.\nThe Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand, or for which cost\nexceeds net realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company\nreviews long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers\' facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances\nindicate the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which\nthe carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and\npurchase commitments are currently recoverable, there can be no assurance the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other charges\ngiven the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes.\nThe Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. Manufacturing purchase\nobligations cover the Company\'s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for periods up to 150 days.

Management believes gross profit margin provides investors with useful information\nrelated to the profitability of our business prior to considering all of the selling, general and administrative expenses and other operating charges incured. Management uses\nthis measure in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating the Company\'s performance.\nOur gross profit margin decreased to 58.1 percent in 2022 from 60.3 percent in 2021. This decrease was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange\nrate fluctuations, increased commodity and transportation costs, and the acquisition of BodyArmor, a finished goods business, in November 2021. The impact of these items\nwas partially offset by favorable pricing initiatives as well as favorable channel and package mix. We expect commodity and transportation costs to continue to have an\nunfavorable impact on our gross profit margin in 2023, and we will continue to proactively take actions in an effort to mitigate the impact of these incremental costs\nSelling,GeneralandAdministrativeExpenses\nThe following table sets forth the components of selling, general and administrative expenses (in millions):\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $736 million, or 6 percent, in 2022.

Management believes gross profit margin provides investors with useful information\nrelated to the profitability of our business prior to considering all of the operating costs incurred. Management uses this measure in making financial, operating and planning\ndecisions and in evaluating the Company\'s performance.\nOur gross profit margin increased to 60.3 percent in 2021 from 59.3 percent in 2020. This increase was primarily due to the impact of favorable pricing initiatives and favorable\nchannel and package mix as well as the gradual recovery in away-from-home channels in many markets throughout 2021, partially offset by the impact of increased commodity\nand transportation\ncosts.

Many of the forward-looking statements are\nlocated in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K under the heading “Business" and Part Il, Item 7 of this Form 10-K under the heading\n"Management\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." Forward-looking statements\nprovide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly\nrelate to any historical or current fact. For example, statements in this Form 10-K regarding the potential future impact of the\nCOviD-19 pandemic on the Company\'s business and results of operations are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking\nstatements can also be identified by words such as "future," "anticipates,” "believes,” “estimates,”" “expects," "intends,”"\n"plans,” "predicts,”""will," "would," "could," "can," "may,”" and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of\nfuture performance and the Company\'s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking\nstatements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this\nForm 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors."

profit margin is a ratio calculated by dividing gross profit by net operating revenues. Management believes gross profit margin provides investors with useful information\nrelated to the profitability of our business prior to considering all of the operating costs incurred. Management uses this measure in making financial, operating and planning\ndecisions and in evaluating the Company\'s performance.\nOur gross profit margin increased to 60.3 percent in 2021 from 59.3 percent in 2020. This increase was primarily due to the impact of favorable pricing initiatives and favorable\nchannel and package mix as well as the gradual recovery in away-from-home channels in many markets throughout 2021, partially offset by the impact of increased commodity\nand transportation\ncosts. We expect commodity and transportation costs to continue to increase in 2022, and we will continue to proactively take actions in an effort to mitigate the impact of these\nincremental costs.\nSelling,GeneralandAdministrativeExpenses\nThe following table sets forth the components of selling, general and administrative expenses (in millions):\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $2,413 million, or 25 percent, in 2021.

Management believes gross profit margin provides investors with useful information\nrelated to the profitability of our business prior to considering all of the selling, general and administrative expenses and other operating charges incured. Management uses\nthis measure in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating the Company\'s performance.\nOur gross profit margin decreased to 58.1 percent in 2022 from 60.3 percent in 2021. This decrease was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange\nrate fluctuations, increased commodity and transportation costs, and the acquisition of BodyArmor, a finished goods business, in November 2021. The impact of these items\nwas partially offset by favorable pricing initiatives as well as favorable channel and package mix.

The shares of common stock to be issued and/or sold upon the exercise of stock options are made\navailable from either authorized and unissued common stock or from treasury shares.

Verify it belongs to KO:\n- If auditing KO, and the chunk discusses a different entity (e.g. Coca-Cola vs Apple), IGNORE it.\n- DATA CROSS-CONTAMINATION IS A TERMINATION OFFENSE.\n\n**2. TABLE ANCHORING (ELIMINATING DATA_GAP):**\nSearch specifically for these anchors in the chunks to find missing metrics:\n- Revenue: "Consolidated Statements of Operations", "Net Sales", "Net Operating Revenues".\n- Cash Flow: "Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows", "Net cash provided by operating activities".\n- Profitability: "Gross Margin", "Operating Income".\nReconstruct the full table logic if values are split across chunks.\n\n**3. SOURCE TRACEABILITY:**\n- You MUST provide the exact **Document Name** (e.g. APPLE_2022_10K.pdf) and **Chunk ID** for every metric.\n- This information is provided at the start of each chunk.\n\n=== EXTRACTION TASK ===\n\n**1.

2026-01-06 21:24:16.298 | INFO     | MAT.actions.calculate_technicals:_llm_interpret_technicals:615 -    Market Regime: The current price of $52.17 is +3.14% above the 20-day moving average (MA20) of $50.58, indicating a short-term upward trend. In the medium-term, the price is +5.27% above the 50-day moving average (MA50) of $49.56, reinforcing the upward momentum. Over the long-term, the price is +8.15% above the 200-day moving average (MA200) of $48.23, suggesting a strong bullish trend. The consistent positive distances across all moving averages indicate a robust upward market regime. However, the significant deviation from the long-term MA200 suggests a potential mean reversion risk, as the price has moved substantially away from its long-term structural support.
2026-01-06 21:24:16.298 | INFO     | MAT.actions.calculate_technicals:_llm_interpret_technicals:616 -    Indicator Tension: The RSI(14) at 66.53 is approaching overbought territory, which aligns with the price being near the upper Bollinger Band of $53.82, indicating strong upward momentum. This momentum is consistent with the positive distances from all moving averages (MA20, MA50, MA200), suggesting alignment between momentum indicators and the multi-period trend structure. There is no immediate conflict, but the elevated RSI suggests caution for potential overextension.
2026-01-06 21:24:16.298 | INFO     | MAT.actions.calculate_technicals:_llm_interpret_technicals:617 -    Dead Cat vs Value: The structural categorization leans towards a 'Value Entry Opportunity' as the price is above all key moving averages (MA20, MA50, MA200), indicating strong support and alignment with the upward trend. The absence of any significant bearish crossover signals and the consistent positive distances from the moving averages suggest a stable trend rather than a dead cat bounce scenario.

2026-01-06 21:26:53.510 | INFO     | MAT.actions.calculate_technicals:_llm_interpret_technicals:615 -    Market Regime: The current price of $52.17 is +3.14% above the 20-day moving average (MA20) of $50.58, indicating a short-term upward trend. In the medium-term, the price is +5.27% above the 50-day moving average (MA50) of $49.55, reinforcing the upward momentum. Over the long-term, the price is +8.15% above the 200-day moving average (MA200) of $48.23, suggesting a strong bullish trend. The consistent positive distances across all moving averages indicate a robust upward market regime. However, the significant deviation from these averages, particularly the long-term MA, introduces a mean reversion risk as the price has moved substantially away from its structural support levels.
2026-01-06 21:26:53.511 | INFO     | MAT.actions.calculate_technicals:_llm_interpret_technicals:616 -    Indicator Tension: The RSI(14) at 66.53 is approaching overbought territory, which aligns with the price being near the upper Bollinger Band of $53.82, suggesting strong upward momentum. This momentum is consistent with the positive distances from all moving averages (MA20, MA50, MA200), indicating alignment between momentum indicators and the multi-period trend structure. There is no immediate conflict, but the elevated RSI suggests caution for potential overextension.
2026-01-06 21:26:53.511 | INFO     | MAT.actions.calculate_technicals:_llm_interpret_technicals:617 -    Dead Cat vs Value: The structural categorization leans towards a 'Value Entry Opportunity' as the price is above all key moving averages (MA20, MA50, MA200), indicating strong support and alignment with the upward trend. The absence of any significant bearish crossover signals and the consistent positive distances from the moving averages suggest a stable trend rather than a dead cat bounce scenario.

Flaring COVID-19 outbreaks had caused a return to lockdowns in many communities, which is a problem because Coke\'s rebound path is sensitive to the level of consumer mobility in a given market.\n\nThe beverage giant\'s recovery did take a step backward in late 2020, management said in a [conference call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/02/10/coca-cola-ko-q4-2020-earnings-call-transcript/) with Wall Street analysts.

It reported revenue of $11.5 billion and adjusted earnings of $0.55 per share, compared to the consensus estimates of $10.7 billion and $0.52, respectively. The company continued to benefit from better price realization. Also, Coca-Cola’s outlook for 2025 aligned with the market expectations. These factors boded well for KO stock, up 5% post the results announcement.\n\nKO stock, with 13% returns since the beginning of 2024, has underperformed the S&P 500 index, up 27%.

Premium segment showing resilience despite macro concerns.",\n       "Macro_Environment": "Headwinds from inflation and supply chain disruptions mentioned across multiple reports. Management cited elevated input costs as margin pressure.",\n       "Management_Confidence": "Cautious guidance with management citing \'uncertain macro backdrop.\' Forward revenue outlook lowered by 3-5% for next quarter.",\n       "Competitive_Position": "Market share gains in services segment noted by analysts. However, smartphone market share faces pressure from competitors in China."\n     }\n\n3. **Causal Narrative (BECAUSE-THEN Logic):**\n   - Synthesize a coherent narrative paragraph (3-5 sentences) using explicit BECAUSE-THEN logic\n   - Connect segment drivers to overall performance causally\n   - Example: "Revenue grew 8% YoY BECAUSE iPhone sales rebounded 10%, WHICH THEN compensated for services growth slowdown. DUE TO inflation pressures, management focused on premium models, WHICH LED TO sustained margins despite volume concerns."\n   - This MUST read like a professional analyst\'s narrative, NOT bullet points\n\n4. **Expectation Gap Analysis (Qualitative):**\n   - Describe "Actual Performance vs. Market Expectations" qualitatively\n   - Identify beats, misses, or inline results with market reaction context\n   - Example: "Revenue beat consensus by 2%, BUT stock fell 3% BECAUSE guidance was cut 5%, revealing investor focus shifted from current quarter to future outlook. Market reaction suggests disappointing forward outlook overshadowed current beat."\n\n5. **Paradoxes and Tensions:**\n   - Identify anomalies: "Good News, Price Drop" or "Revenue Beat, Weak Guidance"\n   - Explain what these contradictions reveal about business health\n   - Example: "Paradox: Strong earnings BUT weak stock reaction. Reflects investor concern that growth is price-driven (unsustainable) rather than volume-driven."\n\n=== OUTPUT FORMAT (STRICT JSON) ===\n{\n    "qualitative_sentiment_assessment": "<Descriptive overall sentiment (1-2 sentences).

The Company had\n$453 million, $391 million and $201 million in interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits accrued as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
