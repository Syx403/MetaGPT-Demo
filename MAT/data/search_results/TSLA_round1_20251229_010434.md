**Relevance Score:** 0.44333586

**Content Snippet:**
```
Although Tesla hasn’t been the highest-quality company lately, it found a few growth initiatives in the past that worked out wonderfully. Its five-year average ROIC was 29.2%, splendid for an industrials business. [...] Tesla shows that fast growth and massive scale can coexist despite conventional wisdom. The company’s revenue base of $25.71 billion five years ago has more than tripled to $92.72 billion in the last year, translating into an incredible 29.2% annualized growth rate. [...] Switching to Energy, revenue grew at a fantastic five-year pace, clocking in at 48.8% annualized. This performance, like Services, trumped its total revenue growth by 19.6 percentage points. On a two-year basis, growth was 41.6%. This is slower than its five-year rate, but it’s impressive nonetheless as it worked off a $5.47 billion revenue base.

While financial metrics soften, bullish analysts continue to reframe NASDAQ:TSLA as an AI-driven autonomy platform rather than an automaker. Tesla’s AI chip roadmap (AI4–AI6) and robotaxi economics are now central to the bullish thesis. [...] Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) trades near $431.77 on December 2, 2025, with a market capitalization of $1.35 trillion, maintaining its place as one of the world’s most polarizing equities. The stock has surged over 7% year-to-date, outperforming most EV peers, but a sharp debate has reignited around its valuation after Michael Burry renewed his short position, claiming Tesla’s market cap is “ridiculously overvalued.” The tension between Tesla’s slowing fundamentals and its high-growth AI narrative [...] From a technical standpoint, NASDAQ:TSLA remains above its 200-day moving average, supported near $428, with short interest around 2.14%. The upper resistance zone sits between $480 and $488, representing the 52-week high.
