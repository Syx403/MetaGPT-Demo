These metrics break it down.\n\nIn the debate over whether [AI (artificial intelligence)](https://www.fool.com/terms/a/artificial-intelligence/) spending is peaking or only getting started, **Nvidia** ([NVDA](/quote/nasdaq/nvda/) +1.09%) just delivered another quarter that strongly supports the latter view. The AI chip specialist reported record results, pointing to a still-growing pipeline of demand as cloud providers race to build new AI infrastructure.\n\nThe quarter was impressive by every measure. [Nvidia](https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/how-to-invest-in-nvidia-stock/)'s revenue growth accelerated again, profitability remained unusually high for a chipmaker, the company continued buying back its stock, and management guided for a huge sequential step-up in sales.\n\nTaken together, five metrics from the company's third-quarter fiscal 2026 report capture just how quickly the business is scaling, showing what's behind Wall Street's love for the stock this year.\n\n![A room full of computer servers.](https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F844423%2Fis-nvda-sock-a-buyy-now-nvidia.jpg&w=3840&op=resize)\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\n## 1. Accelerating revenue growth\n\nThe first number that stands out in Nvidia's third-quarter report is its revenue of $57.0 billion, up 62% year over year and 22% versus the second quarter of fiscal 2026. Importantly, that growth rate marked Nvidia's first year-over-year revenue growth acceleration after six straight quarters of deceleration.\n\nData center revenue did most of the heavy lifting. Sales in that segment reached $51.2 billion -- an increase of 66% from a year earlier and 25% sequentially, as customers bought more Blackwell-generation accelerators and high-bandwidth networking hardware to power AI training and inference workloads.\n\nData center products now account for almost all of Nvidia's growth, showing how central the company has become to modern AI infrastructure.\n\n## 2. Staggering margins\n\nRapid top-line growth would be far less impressive if it came with heavy discounting. Yet Nvidia's gross margins remain unusually strong. On a [non-GAAP](https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/gaap-vs-non-gaap/) basis, third-quarter gross margin was 73.6%, up from 72.7% in the second quarter.\n\nOn a similar note, non-GAAP [operating income](https://www.fool.com/terms"
