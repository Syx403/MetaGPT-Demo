The quarter was impressive by every measure. Nvidia's revenue growth accelerated again, profitability remained unusually high for a chipmaker, the company continued buying back its stock, and management guided for a huge sequential step-up in sales.

Taken together, five metrics from the company's third-quarter fiscal 2026 report capture just how quickly the business is scaling, showing what's behind Wall Street's love for the stock this year.

Nvidia is rated a strong buy, driven by its dominant AI infrastructure position and accelerating GPU architectures amid the end of Moore's Law.
 NVDA's revenue momentum is underpinned by a $0.5 trillion Blackwell/Rubin pipeline, robust hyperscaler demand, and a projected 40% long-term CAGR.
 Key risks include China export controls, power constraints, customer concentration, and potential re-rating if open-source AI or custom silicon erode demand. [...] The strong buy rating is supported by Nvidia’s dominant AI hardware/software moat, 15x Blackwell throughput leap, $0.5T revenue pipeline, and robust hyperscaler demand, with technicals favoring accumulation on dips.
 China export controls and power scarcity could cut NVDA revenue by 15–25% by 2027, especially if Chinese firms shift to domestic chips or hyperscalers adopt custom silicon, warranting close monitoring.

## Summary

* Nvidia is rated a strong buy, driven by its dominant AI infrastructure position and accelerating GPU architectures amid the end of Moore's Law.
* NVDA's revenue momentum is underpinned by a $0.5 trillion Blackwell/Rubin pipeline, robust hyperscaler demand, and a projected 40% long-term CAGR.
* Key risks include China export controls, power constraints, customer concentration, and potential re-rating if open-source AI or custom silicon erode demand.
* I recommend accumulating NVDA on dips ($140.7–$164.3), monitoring GAIN AI Act progress, Chinese chipmaker advances, and new Saudi data center partnerships.

Consensus estimates call for Nvidia’s revenues to rise 63% to $213.2 billion in the current fiscal year, which would end in January 2026, and then rise by almost 50% to $319 billion in the next fiscal year. There could be more upside to these already splendid numbers if Nvidia’s China business gets back on track. Nvidia trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 42.9x while its P/E-to-growth (PEG) multiple is 0.92, which makes it the only Magnificent 7 constituent to have a PEG [...] Nvidia stock (NVDA) is up 41.88% year-to-date and is the second-best performing constituent of the “Magnificent 7” stocks, trailing only Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL), whose 2025 price action surprised even some of the bulls. While Nvidia’s 2025 returns – which are well above twice the average S&P 500 Index ($SPX) constituent – would look stellar, they pale in front of the triple-digit returns that it delivered in the previous two years.

For readers seeking NVDA stock analysis that feels grounded rather than breathless, the lesson is simple. The company’s impact has come from choices that stretched over years, not quarters. CUDA in 2006. Titan in 2012. Mellanox in 2020. Hopper in 2022. Blackwell previewed in March 2024. The numbers that followed, like revenue growth of 101 percent in August 2023 and 262 percent in May 2024, were the echoes of those decisions. The market noticed. The culture did too. And somewhere between the [...] failed megadeal, and one of the most explosive bursts of revenue growth Silicon Valley has ever seen. [...] quarter reported on August 23, 2023, revenue reached $13.51 billion, up 101 percent year over year, as the data center segment took off. By May 22, 2024, the company reported first quarter fiscal 2025 revenue of $26.0 billion, up 262 percent from a year earlier.
