Recent Q4 data highlights a robust gross margin of 46.9%, driven by strong iPhone demand and a rising Average Selling Price (ASP).

# Apple (AAPL): Margins Fall to 24.3%, Challenging Growth Story Behind Premium Valuation

[Simply Wall St](/news/about-simply-wall-st-news)

Reviewed by[Simply Wall St](/news/about-simply-wall-st-news)

Apple (AAPL) reported earnings growth averaging 5.8% per year over the past five years, with net profit margins currently at 24.3% compared to 26.4% a year ago. Despite a forecast for earnings to rise by 8.2% annually and revenue by 5.7% per year, these figures lag behind the broader US market projections. Shares currently trade at $270.37, a premium to the estimated fair value of $231.08. The price-to-earnings ratio is 40.2x, which is well above peers and the global tech industry. While no major risks have been flagged and consensus still points to growth, investors are keeping a close eye on moderating profit margins and growth rates that trail the sector.
