At [ValueSense](https://valuesense.io/?ref=blog.valuesense.io), we've conducted a comprehensive analysis of [Tesla's latest financial data,](https://valuesense.io/ticker/tsla?ref=blog.valuesense.io) competitive positioning, and market dynamics to provide clarity on one of the most polarizing stocks in the market.\n\nThe numbers tell a complex story. With a [**$1.061 trillion market capitalization**](https://valuesense.io/ticker/tsla/market-cap?ref=blog.valuesense.io) and [multiple valuation models](https://valuesense.io/ticker/tsla/intrinsic-value?ref=blog.valuesense.io) screaming \"overvalued,\" Tesla presents both compelling growth prospects and significant valuation concerns that demand careful examination.\n\n## The Valuation Reality Check: What the Numbers Say\n\nOur comprehensive analysis reveals a stark disconnect between Tesla's current market price and traditional valuation methodologies. The data is unequivocal: **Tesla appears to be trading at a 94.5% premium to its** [**intrinsic value**](https://valuesense.io/ticker/tsla/intrinsic-value?ref=blog.valuesense.io) of $18.1 per share, based on discounted cash flow analysis.\n\n### Valuation Metrics That Demand Attention\n\n**Enterprise Value Multiples Paint an Expensive Picture**:  \n([https://valuesense.io/ticker/tsla#key-stats](https://valuesense.io/ticker/tsla?ref=blog.valuesense.io#key-stats))\n\n* **EV/Revenue**: 11.1x (significantly above traditional automotive multiples)\n* **EV/EBIT**: 183.5x (extremely elevated compared to industry standards)\n* **P/E Ratio**: 175.0x (reflecting high growth expectations)\n* **P/FCF**: 187.8x (indicating substantial premium for cash generation)\n\nThese multiples place Tesla in rarefied air, typically reserved for high-growth technology companies rather than automotive manufacturers. The question becomes: can Tesla's business fundamentals justify these premium valuations?\n\n### Financial Health: A Mixed Bag\n\n**Positive Indicators**:\n\n* **Debt-to-Equity**: 9.2% (exceptionally strong balance sheet)\n* **Cash Position**: $36.8B in"

[...] Switching to Energy, revenue grew at a fantastic five-year pace, clocking in at 48.8% annualized. This performance, like Services, trumped its total revenue growth by 19.6 percentage points.
