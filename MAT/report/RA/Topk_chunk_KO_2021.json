        "content": "2 The increase was primarily related to a change in judgment about the Company's tax positions with several foreign jurisdictions.\n3 The decrease was primarily related to a change in judgment about one of the Company's tax positions that became certain as a result of settlement of a matter in the United States.\nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the line item income taxes on our consolidated statement of income. The Company had\n$453 million, $391 million and $201 million in interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits accrued as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Of\nthese amounts, expense of $62 million, $190 million and $11 million was recognized in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively If the Company were to prevail on all uncertain tax\npositions, the reversal of this accrual would be a benefit to the Company's effective tax rate.\nIt is expected that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change in the next 12 months; however, we do not expect any changes will have a significant impact on our\nconsolidated statement of income or consolidated balance sheet. These changes may be the result of settlements of ongoing audits, statute of limitations expiring or final\nsettlements in transfer pricing matters that are the subject of litigation. Currently, an estimate of the range of the reasonably possible outcomes cannot be made.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $2,313 million of loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income. Loss carryforwards of $849 million must be utilized within\nthe next five years, and the remainder can be utilized over a period greater than five years.\nAn analysis of our deferred tax asset valuation allowances is as follows (in millions):\nThe Company's deferred tax asset valuation allowances are primarily the result of uncertainties regarding the future realization of recorded tax benefits on tax loss\ncarryforwards and foreign tax credit carryforwards from operations in various jurisdictions and basis differences in certain equity investments. Current evidence does not\nsuggest we will realize sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character within the carryforward period to allow us to realize these deferred tax benefits. If we were to\nidentify and implement tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or generate sufficient income of the appropriate character in these jurisdictions in the future,\nit could lead to the reversal of these valuation allowances and a reduction of income tax expense. The Company believes that it will generate sufficient future taxable income to\nrealize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets in our consolidated balance sheet.\nIn 2021, the Company recognized a net decrease of $5 million in its valuation allowances. The decrease was primarily due to net decreases in the deferred tax assets and related\nvaluation allowances on certain equity investments and the changes in net operating losses in the normal course of business.\nIn 2020, the Company recognized a net increase of $103 million in its valuation allowances. The increase was primarily due to net increases in the deferred tax assets and\nrelated valuation allowances on certain equity investments. The increase was also due to the increase of valuation allowances after considering significant negative evidence on\nthe utilization of certain net operating losses and excess foreign tax credits.\nIn 2019, the Company recognized a net decrease of $116 million in its valuation allowances. This decrease was primarily due to the reversal of a valuation allowance after\nconsidering significant positive evidence on the utilization of certain net operating losses. This decrease was also due to the reversal of a valuation allowance in our U.S.\noperations related to expenses that were previously determined to be nondeductible and the changes in net operating losses in the normal course of business. The decrease was\npartially offset by an increase in the valuation allowance due to increases in the deferred tax assets and related valuation allowances on certain equity method investments and\nan increase due to the acquisition of foreign operations.\nNOTE15:OTHERCOMPREHENSIVEINCOME\nAOCI attributable to shareowners of The Coca-Cola Company is separately presented in our consolidated balance sheet as a component of The Coca-Cola Company's\nshareowners equity, which also includes our proportionate share of equity method investees' AOCI. OCI attributable to noncontrolling interests is allocated to, and included in,\nour consolidated balance sheet as part of the line item equity attributable to noncontrolling interests.\nAOCI attributable to shareowners of The Coca-Cola Company consisted of the following, net of tax (in millions):\nThe following table summarizes the allocation of total comprehensive income between shareowners of The Coca-Cola Company and noncontrolling interests (in millions):",

We\nreceived cash proceeds of $1,738 million and recognized a net gain of $695 million as a result of the sale and the related reversal of cumulative translation adjustments. Also\nincluded were the sale of our ownership interest in an equity method investee and the sale of a portion of our ownership interest in another equity method investee. We received\ncash proceeds of $293 million and recognized a net gain of $114 million as a result of these sales.\nDuring 2020, proceeds from disposals of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled $189 million, which primarily related to the sale of our\nownership interest in Piedmont Coca-Cola Bottling Partnership to Coca-Cola Consolidated, Inc., an equity method investee. We received cash proceeds of $100 million and\nrecognized a net loss of $2 million as a result of this sale. Also included were the sale of our ownership interest in an equity method investee and the sale of a portion of our\nownership interest in another equity method investee. We received cash proceeds of $62 million and recognized a net gain of $35 million as a result of these sales.\nDuring 2019, proceeds from disposals of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled $429 million, which primarily related to the sale of a\nportion of our ownership interest in Embotelladora Andina S.A. (*Andina\") and the refranchising of certain of our bottling operations in India. As a result of these transactions,\nwe recognized gains of $39 million and $73 million, respectively. We continue to account for our remaining ownership interest in Andina as an equity method investment as a\nresult of our representation on Andina's Board of Directors and other governance rights.\nCoca-ColaBeveragesAfricaProprietaryLimited\nDue to the Company's original intent to refranchise Coca-Cola Beverages Africa Proprietary Limited (*CCBA\"), it was accounted for as held for sale and as a discontinued\noperation from October 2017 through the first quarter of 2019. Additionally, CCBA's property, plant and equipment was not depreciated and its definite-lived intangible assets\nwere not amortized during this period. While the Company had discussions with a number of potential partners throughout the period CCBA was held for sale, during the\nsecond quarter of 2019 the Company updated its plans with the intent to maintain its controlling stake in CCBA, which resulted in CCBA no longer qualifying as held for sale\nor as a discontinued operation. As a result of this change, we recorded a $160 million adjustment to reduce the carrying value of CCBA's property, plant and equipment and\ndefinite-lived intangible assets by an additional $34 million and $126 million, respectively, to reflect additional depreciation and amortization that would have been recognized\nduring the period CCBA was held for sale. This adjustment was recorded in the line item other income (loss) — net in our consolidated statement of income.",

We own or license and market numerous beverage brands, which we group into the following categories: Trademark Coca-Cola; sparkling flavors;\nhydration, sports, coffee and tea; nutrition, juice, dairy and plant-based beverages; and emerging beverages. We own and market five of the world's top six nonalcoholic\nsparkling soft drink brands: Coca-Cola, Sprite, Fanta, Diet Coke and Coca-Cola Zero Sugar.\nWe make our branded beverage products available to consumers throughout the world through our network of independent bottling partners, distributors, wholesalers and\nretailers as well as the Company's consolidated bottling and distribution operations. Beverages bearing trademarks owned by or licensed to us account for 2.1 billion of the\napproximately 63 billion servings of all beverages consumed worldwide every day.\nWe believe our success depends on our ability to connect with consumers by providing them with a wide variety of beverage options to meet their desires, needs and lifestyles.\nOur success further depends on the ability of our peopleto execute effectively, every day.\nOur Company markets, manufactures and sells:\n· beverage concentrates, sometimes referred to as “beverage bases,” and syrups, including fountain syrups (we refer to this part of our business as our “concentrate\noperations\"); and\n· finished sparkling soft drinks and other beverages (we refer to this part of our business as our “finished product operations\").\nGenerally, finished product operations generate higher net operating revenues but lower gross profit margins than concentrate operations.\nOur concentrate operations typically generate net operating revenues by selling concentrates, syrups and certain finished beverages to authorized bottling operations (to which\nwe typically refer as our bottlers”? or our bottling partners\"). Our bottling partners either combine concentrates with still or sparkling water and sweeteners (depending on the\nproduct), or combine syrups with still or sparkling water, to produce finished beverages. The finished beverages are packaged in authorized containers, such as cans and\nrefillableandnnrefillabl glass and plasticot beaing ur rademarks or rademarks liensed tous and are thn sold tretailer directly or, in some case, through\nwholesalers or other bottlers. In addition, outside the United States, our bottling partners are typically authorized to manufacture fountain syrups, using our concentrates, which\nthey sell to fountain retailers for use in producing beverages for immediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers who\nin turn sell and distribute the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. Our concentrate operations are included in our geographic operating segments and our Global Ventures\noperatingsegment.\nOur finished product operations generate net operating revenues by selling sparkling soft drinks and a variety of other finished beverages to retailers, or to distributors and\nwholesalers who in turn sell the beverages to retailers. These operations consist primarily of our consolidated bottling and distribution operations, which are included in our\nBottling Investments operating segment. In certain markets, the Company also operates non-botling finished product operations in which we sell finished beverages to\ndistributors and wholesalers that are generally not one of the Company's bottling partners. These operations are generally included in one of our geographic operating segments\nOr our Global Ventures operating segment. Additionally, we sell directly to consumers through retail stores operated by Costa. These sales are included in our Global Ventures\noperating segment. In the United States, we manufacture fountain syrups and sell them to fountain retailers, who use the fountain syrups to produce beverages for immediate\nconsumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers or bottling partners who in turn sell the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. These fountain syrup sales are included in our\nNorth America operating segment.\nThe following table sets forth the percentage of total net operating revenues attributable to concentrate operations and finished product operations:\nThe following table sets forth the percentage of total worldwide unit case volume attributable to concentrate operations and finished product operations:\nWe operate in the highly competitive commercial beverage industry. We face strong competition from numerous other general and specialty beverage companies. We, along\nwith other beverage companies, are affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the cost to manufacture and distribute products, consumer spending, economic\nconditions, availability and quality of water, consumer preferences, inflation, political climates, local and national laws and regulations, foreign currency fluctuations, fuel\nprices, weather patterns and the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThroughout 2021, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related actions by governments around the world to attempt to contain the spread of the virus continued to\nimpact our business globally. In particular, the number of people contracting COVID-19 and the preventive measures taken to contain COVID-19, including the spread of new\nvariants, negatively impacted our unit case volume and increased our costs to manufacture and distribute our products. Our price, product and geographic mix was also\nnegatively impacted, primarily due to unfavorable channel and product mix as consumer demand shifted to more at-home consumption versus away-from-home consumption.\nHowever, the timing and number of people receiving vaccinations, the governmental actions to reopen certain economies around the world, and the substance and pace of the\neconomic recovery favorably impacted our business when compared to 2020. While uncertainties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic remain, and factors such as the state of\nthe supply chain, labor shortages and the inflationary environment are likely to impact the pace of the economic recovery, we expect to continue to see improvements in our\nbusiness as we continue to learn and adapt to the ever-changing environment.\nThe Company's priorities during the COVID-19 pandemic and related business disruptions are ensuring the health and safety of our employees; supporting and making a\ndifference in the communities we serve; keeping our brands in supply; maintaining the quality and safety of our products; and serving our customers across all channels as they\nadapt to the shifting demands of consumers during the pandemic.\nThroughout the pandemic, business continuity and adapting to the needs of our customers have been critical. We have developed systemwide knowledge-sharing routines and\nprocesses, which include the management of any supply chain challenges. As of the date of this filing, while we have experienced some temporary supply chain disruptions,\nthere has been no material impact, and we do not foresee a material impact, on our and our bottling partners? ability to manufacture or distribute our products.\nDespite the pandemic, we are not losing sight of long-term opportunities for our business. The pandemic helped us realize we could be much bolder in our efforts to change. We\nidentified the following key objectives to navigate the pandemic and position us to capture growth: winning more consumers; gaining market share; maintaining strong system\neconomics; strengthening stakeholder impact; and equipping the organization to win. In order to deliver against these objectives, we focused on the following priorities:\nunlocking the potential of our portfolio of strong global, regional and scaled local brands; developing a robust innovation pipeline focusing on scalable initiatives; increasing\nconsumer-centric marketing effectiveness and efficiency; winning in the marketplace with aligned data-driven revenue growth management and execution capabilities; and\nfurther embedding ESG goals into our operations. In August 2020, the Company announced strategic steps to transform our organizational structure to better enable us to\ncapture growth in the fast-changing marketplace. The Company has transformed into a networked global organization designed to combine the power of scale with the deep\nknowledge required to win locally.

        "content": "OURBUSINESS\nGeneral\nThe Coca-Cola Company is a total beverage company, and beverage products bearing our trademarks, sold in the United States since 1886, are now sold in more than 200\ncountries and territories. We own or license and market numerous beverage brands, which we group into the following categories: Trademark Coca-Cola; sparkling flavors;\nwater, sports, coffee and tea; juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages; and emerging beverages. We own and market five of the world's top six nonalcoholic\nsparkling soft drink brands: Coca-Cola, Sprite, Fanta, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar and Diet Coke/Coca-Cola Light.\nWe make our branded beverage products available to consumers throughout the world through our network of independent bottling partners, distributors, wholesalers and\nretailers as well as the Company's consolidated bottling and distribution operations. Beverages bearing trademarks owned by or licensed to us account for 2.2 billion of the\nestimated 64 billion servings of all beverages consumed worldwide every day\nWe believe our success depends on our ability to connect with consumers by providing them with a wide variety of beverage options to meet their desires, needs and lifestyles.\nOur success further depends on the ability of our people to execute effectively, every day.\nOur Company markets, manufactures and sells:\n· beverage concentrates, sometimes referred to as *beverage bases,” and syrups, including fountain syrups (we refer to this part of our business as our “concentrate\noperations\"); and\n· finished sparkling soft drinks and other beverages (we refer to this part of our business as our “finished product operations\").\nGenerally, finished product operations generate higher net operating revenues but lower gross profit margins than concentrate operations.\nOur concentrate operations typically generate net operating revenues by selling concentrates, syrups and certain finished beverages to authorized bottling operations (to which\nwe typically refer as our “bottlers”? or our “bottling partners\"). Our bottling partners either combine concentrates with still or sparkling water and sweeteners (depending on the\nproduct), or combine syrups with still or sparkling water, to produce finished beverages. The finished beverages are packaged in authorized containers, such as cans and\nrefillable and nonrefillable glass and plastic bottles, bearing our trademarks or trademarks licensed to us and are then sold to retailers directly or, in some cases, through\nwholesalers or other bottlers. In addition, outside the\nUnited States, our bottling partners are typically authorized to manufacture fountain syrups, using our concentrates, which they sell to fountain retailers for use in producing\nbeverages for immediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers who in turn sell and distribute the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. Our concentrate operations\nare included in our geographic operating segments and our Global Ventures operating segment.\nOur finished product operations generate net operating revenues by selling sparkling soft drinks and a variety of other fnished beverages to retailers, or to distributors and\nwholesalers who in turn sell the beverages to retailers. These operations consist primarily of our consolidated bottling and distribution operations, which are included in our\nBottling Investments operating segment. In certain markets, the Company also operates non-bottling finished product operations in which we sell finished beverages to\ndistributors and wholesalers that are generally not one of the Company's bottling partners. These operations are generally included in one of our geographic operating segments\nor our Global Ventures operating segment. Additionally, we sell directly to consumers through retail stores operated by Costa. These sales are included in our Global Ventures\noperating segment. In the United States, we manufacture fountain syrups and sell them to fountain retailers, who use the fountain syrups to produce beverages for immediate\nconsumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers or bottling partners who in turn sell the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. These fountain syrup sales are included in our\nNorth America operating segment.\nThe following table sets forth the percentage of total net operating revenues attributable to concentrate operations and finished product operations:\nThe following table sets forth the percentage of total worldwide unit case volume attributable to concentrate operations and finished product operations:\nWe operate in the highly competitive commercial beverage industry. We face strong competition from numerous other general and specialty beverage companies. We, along\nwith other beverage companies, are affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the cost to manufacture and distribute products, consumer spending, economic\nconditions, availability and quality of water, consumer preferences, inflation, geopolitical conditions, local and national laws and regulations, foreign currency exchange rate\nfluctuations, fuel prices, weather patterns and the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOn March 8, 2022, the Company announced the suspension of its business in Russia as a result of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. In addition, the conflict has caused\na disruption of our business in Ukraine. The Company will continue to monitor and assess the situation as circumstances evolve. As a point of reference, in 2021, the\nCompany's business in Russia and Ukraine contributed 2 percent of the Company's unit case volume and 1 percent and 2 percent of the Company's consolidated net operating\nrevenues and operating income, respectively.\nThroughout 2022, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the resurgence of the virus in certain countries and the related actions by governments to attempt to contain\nthe spread of the virus, continued to negatively impact our business. While uncertainties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic remain, and factors such as the state of the supply\nchain, labor shortages and the inflationary environment are likely to impact the pace of the economic recovery, we are focused on executing for growth.\nDespite the dynamic world in which we are currently operating, we believe we are well positioned to create value for our Company and our stakeholders. In an effort to support\nour future growth, we are continuing to invest in our portfolio of brands, our strategic capabilities and our people. We are focused on the following strategic priorities:\nunlocking the potential of our portfolio of strong global, regional and scaled local brands; developing a robust innovation pipeline focusing on scalable initiatives; increasing\nconsumer-centric marketing effectiveness and efficiency; winning in the marketplace with aligned data-driven revenue growth management and execution capabilities; and\nfurther embedding sustainability goals into our operations.",

We own or license and market numerous beverage brands, which we group into the following categories: Trademark Coca-Cola; sparkling flavors;\nhydration, sports, coffee and tea; nutrition, juice, dairy and plant-based beverages; and emerging beverages. We own and market five of the world's top six nonalcoholic\nsparkling soft drink brands: Coca-Cola, Sprite, Fanta, Diet Coke and Coca-Cola Zero Sugar.\nWe make our branded beverage products available to consumers throughout the world through our network of independent bottling partners, distributors, wholesalers and\nretailers as well as the Company's consolidated bottling and distribution operations. Beverages bearing trademarks owned by or licensed to us account for 2.1 billion of the\napproximately 63 billion servings of all beverages consumed worldwide every day.\nWe believe our success depends on our ability to connect with consumers by providing them with a wide variety of beverage options to meet their desires, needs and lifestyles.\nOur success further depends on the ability of our peopleto execute effectively, every day.\nOur Company markets, manufactures and sells:\n· beverage concentrates, sometimes referred to as “beverage bases,” and syrups, including fountain syrups (we refer to this part of our business as our “concentrate\noperations\"); and\n· finished sparkling soft drinks and other beverages (we refer to this part of our business as our “finished product operations\").\nGenerally, finished product operations generate higher net operating revenues but lower gross profit margins than concentrate operations.\nOur concentrate operations typically generate net operating revenues by selling concentrates, syrups and certain finished beverages to authorized bottling operations (to which\nwe typically refer as our bottlers”? or our bottling partners\"). Our bottling partners either combine concentrates with still or sparkling water and sweeteners (depending on the\nproduct), or combine syrups with still or sparkling water, to produce finished beverages. The finished beverages are packaged in authorized containers, such as cans and\nrefillableandnnrefillabl glass and plasticot beaing ur rademarks or rademarks liensed tous and are thn sold tretailer directly or, in some case, through\nwholesalers or other bottlers. In addition, outside the United States, our bottling partners are typically authorized to manufacture fountain syrups, using our concentrates, which\nthey sell to fountain retailers for use in producing beverages for immediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers who\nin turn sell and distribute the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. Our concentrate operations are included in our geographic operating segments and our Global Ventures\noperatingsegment.\nOur finished product operations generate net operating revenues by selling sparkling soft drinks and a variety of other finished beverages to retailers, or to distributors and\nwholesalers who in turn sell the beverages to retailers. These operations consist primarily of our consolidated bottling and distribution operations, which are included in our\nBottling Investments operating segment. In certain markets, the Company also operates non-botling finished product operations in which we sell finished beverages to\ndistributors and wholesalers that are generally not one of the Company's bottling partners. These operations are generally included in one of our geographic operating segments\nOr our Global Ventures operating segment. Additionally, we sell directly to consumers through retail stores operated by Costa. These sales are included in our Global Ventures\noperating segment. In the United States, we manufacture fountain syrups and sell them to fountain retailers, who use the fountain syrups to produce beverages for immediate\nconsumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers or bottling partners who in turn sell the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. These fountain syrup sales are included in our\nNorth America operating segment.\nThe following table sets forth the percentage of total net operating revenues attributable to concentrate operations and finished product operations:\nThe following table sets forth the percentage of total worldwide unit case volume attributable to concentrate operations and finished product operations:\nWe operate in the highly competitive commercial beverage industry. We face strong competition from numerous other general and specialty beverage companies. We, along\nwith other beverage companies, are affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the cost to manufacture and distribute products, consumer spending, economic\nconditions, availability and quality of water, consumer preferences, inflation, political climates, local and national laws and regulations, foreign currency fluctuations, fuel\nprices, weather patterns and the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThroughout 2021, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related actions by governments around the world to attempt to contain the spread of the virus continued to\nimpact our business globally. In particular, the number of people contracting COVID-19 and the preventive measures taken to contain COVID-19, including the spread of new\nvariants, negatively impacted our unit case volume and increased our costs to manufacture and distribute our products. Our price, product and geographic mix was also\nnegatively impacted, primarily due to unfavorable channel and product mix as consumer demand shifted to more at-home consumption versus away-from-home consumption.\nHowever, the timing and number of people receiving vaccinations, the governmental actions to reopen certain economies around the world, and the substance and pace of the\neconomic recovery favorably impacted our business when compared to 2020. While uncertainties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic remain, and factors such as the state of\nthe supply chain, labor shortages and the inflationary environment are likely to impact the pace of the economic recovery, we expect to continue to see improvements in our\nbusiness as we continue to learn and adapt to the ever-changing environment.\nThe Company's priorities during the COVID-19 pandemic and related business disruptions are ensuring the health and safety of our employees; supporting and making a\ndifference in the communities we serve; keeping our brands in supply; maintaining the quality and safety of our products; and serving our customers across all channels as they\nadapt to the shifting demands of consumers during the pandemic.\nThroughout the pandemic, business continuity and adapting to the needs of our customers have been critical. We have developed systemwide knowledge-sharing routines and\nprocesses, which include the management of any supply chain challenges. As of the date of this filing, while we have experienced some temporary supply chain disruptions,\nthere has been no material impact, and we do not foresee a material impact, on our and our bottling partners? ability to manufacture or distribute our products.\nDespite the pandemic, we are not losing sight of long-term opportunities for our business. The pandemic helped us realize we could be much bolder in our efforts to change. We\nidentified the following key objectives to navigate the pandemic and position us to capture growth: winning more consumers; gaining market share; maintaining strong system\neconomics; strengthening stakeholder impact; and equipping the organization to win. In order to deliver against these objectives, we focused on the following priorities:\nunlocking the potential of our portfolio of strong global, regional and scaled local brands; developing a robust innovation pipeline focusing on scalable initiatives; increasing\nconsumer-centric marketing effectiveness and efficiency; winning in the marketplace with aligned data-driven revenue growth management and execution capabilities; and\nfurther embedding ESG goals into our operations. In August 2020, the Company announced strategic steps to transform our organizational structure to better enable us to\ncapture growth in the fast-changing marketplace. The Company has transformed into a networked global organization designed to combine the power of scale with the deep\nknowledge required to win locally.

When we record our proportionate share of\nnet income, it increases equity income (loss) — net in our consolidated statement of income and our carrying value of that investment. Conversely, when we record our\nproportionate share of a net loss, it decreases equity income (loss) — net in our consolidated statement of income and our carrying value of that investment. The Company's\nproportionate share of the net income or loss of our equity method investees includes significant operating and nonoperating items recorded by our equity method investees.\nThese items can have a significant impact on the amount of equity income (loss) — net in our consolidated statement of income and our carrying value of those investments.\nRefer to Note 17 for additional information related to significant operating and nonoperating items recorded by our equity method investees. The carrying values of our equity\nmethod investments are also impacted by our proportionate share of items impacting the equity method investees? AOCI.\nWe eliminate from our financial results all significant intercompany transactions to the extent of our ownership interest, including the intercompany portion of transactions with\nequity method investees.\nThe Company's equity method investments include, but are not limited to, our ownership interests in CCEP, Monster, AC Bebidas, S. de R.L. de C.V., Coca-Cola\nFEMSA, S.A.B. de C.V., Coca-Cola HBC AG and Coca-Cola Bottlers Japan Holdings Inc. (*CCBJHI\"). As of December 31, 2021, we owned approximately 19 percent, 19\npercent, 20 percent, 28 percent, 21 percent and 19 percent, respectively, of these companies? outstanding shares. As of December 31, 2021, our investments in our equity\nmethod investees in the aggregate exceeded our proportionate share of the net assets of these equity method investees by $7,298 million. This difference is not amortized.\nA summary of financial information for our equity method investees in the aggregate is as follows (in millions):\nNet sales to equity method investees, the majority of which are located outside the United States, were $14,471 million, $13,041 million and $14,832 million in 2021, 2020 and\n2019, respectively. Total payments, primarily related to marketing, made to equity method investees were $516 million, $547 million and $897 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019,\nrespectively. The increase in net sales to equity method investees in 2021 was primarily due to recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, purchases of beverage\nproducts from equity method investees were $496 million, $452 million and $426 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in purchases of beverage products\nin 2021 was primarily due to increased purchases of Monster products as a result of international expansion and category growth.\nThe following table presents the difference between calculated fair value, based on quoted closing prices of publicly traded shares, and our Company's carrying value in\ninvestments in publicly traded companies accounted for under the equity method (in millions):\n1The carrying value of our investment in CCBJHI exceeded its fair value as of December 31, 2021 by $87 million. Based on the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less\nthan our carrying value and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value, management determined that the\ndecline in fair value was temporary in nature. Therefore, we did not record an impairment charge related to the investment.\nNetReceivablesandDividendsfromEquityMethodInvestees\nTotal net receivables due from equity method investees were $882 million and $1,025 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The total amount of dividends\nreceived from equity method investes was $823 million, $467 million and $628 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The amount of\nconsolidated reinvested earnings that represents undistributed earnings of investments accounted for under the equity method as of December 31, 2021 was $6,143 million.",

        "content": "1 The increase was primarily related to a change in judgment on certain tax positions due to the Opinion. Refer to Note 1l of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the line item income taxes on our consolidated statement of income. The Company had\n$453 million and $391 million in interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits accrued as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Of these amounts, expense\nof $62 million and $190 million was recognized in 2021 and 2020, respectively. If the Company were to prevail on all uncertain tax positions, the reversal of this accrual would\nbe a benefit to the Company's effective tax rate.\nBased on current tax laws, the Company's effective tax rate in 2022 is expected to be approximately 20 percent before considering the potential impact of any significant\noperating and nonoperating items that may affect our effective tax rate.\nLiquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position\nWe believe our ability to generate cash flows from operating activities is one of the fundamental strengths of our business. Refer to the heading “Cash Flows from Operating\nActivities” below. The Company does not typically raise capital through the issuance of stock. Instead, we use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital and increase\nour return on shareowners? equity. Refer to the heading “Cash Flows from Financing Activities\" below. We have a history of borrowing funds both domestically and\ninternationally at reasonable interest rates, and we expect to be able to continue to borrow funds at reasonable rates over the long term. Our debt financing also includes the use\nof a commercial paper program. We currently have the ability to borrow funds in this market at levels that are consistent with our debt financing strategy and expect to continue\nto be able to do so in the future.\nThe Company reviews its optimal mix of short-term and long-term debt regularly and, as a result of this review, during 2021 we issued U.S. dollar- and euro-denominated long-\nterm notes of $6.0 billion and E3.2 billion, respectively, across various maturities. We used a portion of the proceeds from these issuances to extinguish certain tranches of our\npreviously issued long-term debt. Refer to Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these issuances and extinguishments.\nThe Company's cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and marketable securities totaled $12.6 billion as of December 31, 2021. In addition to these funds, our\ncommercial paper program and our ability to issue long-term debt, we had $8.1 billion in unused backup lines of credit for general corporate purposes as of December 31, 2021.\nThese backup lines of credit expire at various times from 2022 through 2027.\nWhile uncertainties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic remain, we expect to continue to see improvements in our business as vaccines become more widely available. The\ntiming and availability of vaccines will be different around the world, and therefore we believe the pace of the recovery will vary by geography depending on vaccine\navailability, rates of vaccination and the effectiveness of vaccines against existing and new variants of the virus, along with other macroeconomic factors. We will remain\nflexible so that we can adjust to uncertainties resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Our current capital allocation priorities are as follows: investing wisely to support our\nbusiness operations, continuing to grow our dividend payment, enhancing our beverage portfolio and capabilities through opportunistic and disciplined acquisitions, and using\nexcess cash to repurchase shares over time. We currently expect 2022 capital expenditures to be approximately $1.5 billion. During 2022, we also expect to repurchase\napproximately $500 million of shares in addition to repurchasing shares equivalent to the proceeds from the issuances of stock under our stock-based compensation plans.\nWe are currently in litigation with the IRS for tax years 2007 through 2009. On November 18, 2020, the Tax Court issued the Opinion in which it predominantly sided with the\nIRS; however, a final decision is still pending and the timing of such decision is not currently known. The Company strongly disagrees with the IRS' positions and the portions\nof the Opinion affrming such positions and intends to vigorously defend our positions uilizing every available avenue of appeal. While the Company believes that i is more\nlikely than not that we will ultimately prevail in this litigation upon appeal, it is possible that all, or some portion of, the adjustments proposed by the IRS and sustained by the\nTax Court could ultimately be upheld. In the event that all of the adjustments proposed by the IRS are ultimately upheld for tax years 2007 through 2009 and the IRS, with the\nconsent of the federal courts, were to decide to apply the Tax Court Methodology to the subsequent years up to and including 2021, the Company currently estimates that the\npotential aggregate incremental tax and interest liability could be approximately $13 billion as of December 31, 2021. Additional income tax and interest would continue to\naccrue until the time any such potential liability, or portion thereof, were to be paid. Once the Tax Court renders a final decision, the Company will have 90 days to file a notice\nof appeal and pay the portion of the potential aggregate incremental tax and interest liability related to the 2007 through 2009 tax years, which we currently estimate to be\napproximately $4.9 billion (including interest accrued through December 31, 2021), plus any additional interest accrued through the time of payment. Refer to Note 11 of Notes\nto Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the tax litigation.\nWhile we believe it is more likely than not that we will prevail in the tax litigation discussed above, we are confident that, between our ability to generate cash flows from\noperating activities and our ability to borrow funds at reasonable interest rates, we can manage the range of possible outcomes in the final resolution of the matter.\nBased on all of the aforementioned factors, the Company believes its current liquidity position is strong and will continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and\ncash commitments for investing and financing activities for the foreseeable future.\nCashFlowsfromOperatingActivities\nAs part of our continued efforts to improve our working capital efficiency, we have worked with our suppliers over the past several years to revisit terms and conditions,\nincluding the extension of payment terms. Our current payment terms with the majority of our suppliers are 120 days. Additionally, two global financial institutions offer a\nvoluntary supply chain finance (*SCF\") program which enables our suppliers, at their sole discretion, to sell their receivables from the Company to these\nfinancial institutions on a non-recourse basis at a rate that leverages our credit rating and thus may be more beneficial to them. The SCF program is available to suppliers of\ngoods and services included in cost of goods sold as well as suppliers of goods and services included in selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated\nstatement of income. The Company and our suppliers agree on the contractual terms for the goods and services we procure, including prices, quantities and payment terms,\nregardless of whether the supplier elects to participate in the SCF program. The suppliers sell goods or services, as applicable, to the Company and issue the associated invoices\nto the Company based on the agreed-upon contractual terms. Then, if they are participating in the SCF program, our suppliers, at their sole discretion, determine which\ninvoices, if any, they want to sell to the financial institutions. Our suppliers? voluntary inclusion of invoices in the SCF program has no bearing on our payment terms. No\nguarantees are provided by the Company or any of our subsidiaries under the SCF program. We have no economic interest in a supplier's decision to participate in the SCF\nprogram, and we have ndirect financial relationshp with the financial institutions, asit relates to the CF program.Accordingly,amounts u to our suppliers that elctd t\nparticipate in the SCF program are included in the line itm accounts payable and accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheet. Allactivity relatd to amounts de to\nsuppliers that elected to participate in the SCF program is reflected within the operating activities section of our consolidated statement of cash flows. We have been informed\nby the financial institutions that as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, suppliers had elected to sell $882 million and $703 million, respectively, of our outstanding payment\nobligations to the financial institutions. The amounts settled through the SCF program were $3,237 million and $2,810 million during the years ended December 31, 2021 and\n2020, respectively. We do not believe there is a risk that our payment terms will be shortened in the near future.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company started a trade accounts receivable factoring program in certain countries. Under this program we can elect to sell trade accounts\nreceivables to unaffliated fnancial institutions a a discount. In these factoring arrangements, for ease of administration, the Company collcts customer payments related t\nthe factored receivables and remits those payments to the financial institutions. The Company sold $6,266 million and $185 million of trade accounts receivables under this\nprogram during the years ended Decmber 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and the costs of factoring such receivables were not material. The cash received from the financial\ninstitutions is classified within the operating activities section in our consolidated statement of cash flows.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $12,625 million and $9,844 million, respectively, an increase of $2,781 million,\nor 28 percent. This increase was primarily driven by increased operating income, which includes a benefit from our trade accounts receivable factoring program, a favorable\nimpact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, lower annual incentive payments in 2021 as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operating\nperformance in 2020, lower payments in 2021 of prior year-end marketing accruals due to lower spending in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and lower\nprepayments to customers in 2021. These items were partially ofset by higher payments related to our strategic realignment initiatives along with higher tax payments in 2021.\nCashFlowsfromInvestingActivities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $2,765 million and $1,477 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nPurchases of Investments and Proceeds fromDisposals of Investments\nIn 2021, purchases of investments were $6,030 million and proceeds from disposals of investments were $7,059 million, resulting in a net cash inflow of $1,029 million. In\n2020, purchases of investments were $13,583 million and proceeds from disposals of investments were $13,835 million, resulting in a net cash inflow of $252 million. This\nactivity primarily represents the purchases of, and proceeds from the disposals of, investments in marketable securities and short-term investments that were made as part of the\nCompany's overall cash management strategy. Also included in this activity are purchases of, and proceeds from the disposals of, investments held by our captive insurance\ncompanies.\nAcquisitions of Businesses,EquityMethod Investments and NonmarketableSecurities\nIn 2021, the Company's acquisitions of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled $4,766 million, which primarily related to the acquisition of\nthe remaining ownership interest in BodyArmor.\nIn 2020, the Company's acquisitions of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled $1,052 million, which primarily related to the acquisition of\nthe remaining ownership interest in fairlife.\nRefer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our acquisitions.\nProceeds fromDisposals ofBusinesses,Equity Method Investments and NonmarketableSecurities\nIn 2021, proceeds from disposals of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities were $2,180 million, which primarily related to the sale of our\nownership interest in CCA, an equity method investee, to CCEP, also an equity method investee.\nIn 2020, proceeds from disposals of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities were $189 million, which primarily related to the sale of our\nownership interest in Piedmont Coca-Cola Bottling Partnership to Coca-Cola Consolidated, Inc., an equity method investee.\nRefer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our disposals.\nPurchasesofProperty,PlantandEquipment\nPurchases of property, plant and equipment during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $1,367 million and $1,177 million, respectively\nTotal capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment and the percentage of such totals by operating segment and Corporate were as follows (in millions):\nCashFlowsfromFinancingActivities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $6,786 million and $8,070 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively\nDebt Financing\nOur Company maintains debt levels we consider prudent based on our cash flows, interest coverage ratio and percentage of debt to capital. We use debt financing to lower our\noverall cost of capital, which increases our return on shareowners? equity. This exposes us to adverse changes in interest rates. Our interest expense may also be affected by our\ncredit ratings.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our long-term debt was rated “A+\" by Standard & Poor's and “A1\" by Moody's. Our commercial paper program was rated “A-1\" by Standard &\nPoor's and *p-1 by Moody's. In assessing our credit strength, both rating agencies consider our capital structure (including the amount and maturity dates of our debt) and\nfinancial policies as well as the consolidated balance sheet and other financial information of the Company. In addition, certain rating agencies also consider the financial\ninformation of certain bottlers, including CCEP, Coca-Cola Consolidated, Inc., Coca-Cola FEMSA and Coca-Cola Hellenic. While the Company has no legal obligation for the\ndebt of these bottlers, the rating agencies believe the strategic importance of the bottlers to the Company's business model provides the Company with an incentive to keep\nthese bottlers viable. It is our expectation that these rating agencies will continue using this methodology. If our credit ratings were to be downgraded as a result of changes in\nour capital structure, our major bottlers? financial performance, changes in the credit rating agencies methodology in assessing our credit strength, or for any other reason, our\ncost of borrowing could increase. Additionally, if certain bottlers credit ratings were to decline, the Company's equity income could be reduced as a result of the potential\nincrease in interest expense for those bottlers.\nWe monitor our financial ratios and, as indicated above, the rating agencies consider these ratios in assessing our credit ratings. Each rating agency employs a different\naggregation methodology and has different thresholds for the various financial ratios. These thresholds are not necessarily permanent, nor are they always fully disclosed to our\nCompany.\nOur global presence and strong capital position give us access to key financial markets around the world, enabling us to borrow funds at a low effective cost. This posture,\ncoupled with active management of our mix of short-term and long-term debt as well as our mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt, results in a lower overall cost of\nborrowing. Our debt management policies, in conjunction with our share repurchase program and investment activity, can result in current liabilities exceeding current assets.\nIssuances and payments of debt included both short-term and long-term financing activities. During 2021, the Company had issuances of debt of $13,094 million, which\nincluded $3,391 million of issuances related to commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities greater than 90 days and $80 million of net issuances related to\ncommercial paper and short-term debt with maturities of 90 days or less. The Company's total long-term debt issuances were $9,623 million, net of related discounts and\nissuancecosts.\nDuring 2021, the Company made payments of debt of $12,866 million, which consisted of $2,357 million of payments related to commercial paper and short-term debt with\nmaturities greater than 90 days and payments of long-term debt of $10,509 million.\nDuring 2020, the Company had issuances of debt of $26,934 million, which included $8,260 million of issuances related to commercial paper and short-term debt with\nmaturities greater than 90 days and long-term debt issuances of $18,674 million, net of related discounts and issuance costs.\nDuring 2020, the Company made payments of debt of $28,796 million, which included $15,292 million of payments related to commercial paper and short-term debt with\nmaturities greater than 90 days and $1,768 million net issuances related to commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities of 90 days or less. The Company's total\npayments of long-term debt were $11,736 million.\nOn December 31, 2021, the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority, the governing body responsible for regulating LIBOR, ceased to publish certain LIBOR reference\nrates. However, other LIBOR reference rates, including U.S. dollar overnight, 1-month, 3-month, 6-month and 12-month maturities will continue to be published through June\n2023. In preparation for the discontinuation of LIBOR, wehave amended, or willamend, our LOR-referencing agreements to either reference the Secured Overnight\nFinancing Rate or include mechanics for selecting an alternative rate. We do not plan to enter into variable-rate agreements that reference LIOR after Decmber 31, 2021.\nIssuancesofStock\nThe issuances of stock in 2021 and 2020 were related to the exercise of stock options by Company employees.\nShareRepurchases\nIn 2012, the Board ofDirectors authorized a share repurchase plan ofup to 500 millon shares of the Company's common stock. In 2019, our Board of Directors authorized a\nnew plan for the Company to purchase up to an additional 150 million shares of our common stock\nDuring 2021 and 2020, the Company did not repurchase common stock under the share repurchase plan authorized by our Board of Directors. Since the inception of our share\nrepurchase program in 1984, we have purchased 3.5 billion shares of our common stock at an average price per share of $17.25. In addition to shares repurchased under the\nshare repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors, the Company's treasury stock activity also includes shares surrendered to the Company to pay the exercise\nprice and/or to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with so-called stock swap exercises of employee stock options and/or the vesting of restricted stock issued to\nemployees. The Company's treasury stock activity during 2021 resulted in a cash outflow of $111 million.\nDividends\nThe Company paid dividends of $7,252 million and $7,047 million during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nAt its February 2022 meeting, our Board of Directors increased our regular quarterly dividend to $0.44 per share, equivalent to a full year dividend of $1.76 per share in 2022.\nThis is our 60th consecutive annual increase. Our annualized common stock dividend was $1.68 per share and $1.64 per share in 2021 and 2020, respectively.",

        "content": "RecoverabilityofCurrent andNoncurrentAssets\nOur Company faces many uncertainties and risks related to various economic, political and regulatory environments in the countries in which we operate, particularly in\ndeveloping and emerging markets. Refer to the heading “Our Business — Challenges and Risks\"” above and “Item 1A. Risk Factors\" in Part I of this report. As a result,\nmanagement must make numerous assumptions, which involve a significant amount of judgment, when performing recoverability and impairment tests of current and\nnoncurrent assets in various regions around the world.\nWe perform recoverability and impairment tests of current and noncurrent assets in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For certain assets, recoverability and/or impairment tests are\nrequired only when conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. For other assets, impairment tests are required at least annually, or more frequently\nif events or circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired.\nThe performance of recoverability and impairment tests of current and noncurrent assets involves critical accounting estimates. These estimates require significant management\njudgment, include inherent uncertainties and are often interdependent; therefore, they do not change in isolation. Factors that management must estimate include, among others,\nthe economic lives of the assets, sales volume, pricing, royalty rates, cost of raw materials, delivery costs, the impact of any supply chain disruptions, inflation, long-term\ngrowth rates, cost of capital, marketing spending, foreign currency exchange rates, tax rates, capital spending, proceeds from the sale of assets and customers? financial\ncondition. These factors are even more difficult to estimate as a result of uncertainties associated with the scope, severity and duration of the global COVID-19 pandemic and\nany resurgences of the pandemic, including, but not limited to, the number of people contracting the virus; the impact of shelter-in-place and social distancing requirements; the\nimpact of governmental actions across the globe to contain the virus; vaccine availability, rates of vaccination and effectiveness of vaccines against existing and new variants of\nthe virus; governmental or other vaccine mandates and any associated business and supply chain disruptions; and the substance and pace of the economic recovery. The\nestimates we use when performing recoverability tests of assets are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. When performing impairment tests, we estimate the\nfair values of the assets using management's best assumptions, which we believe are consistent with those a market participant would use The variability of these factors\ndepends on a number of conditions, including uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, and thus our accounting estimates may change from period to period.\nWhile uncertainties still exist, we expect to see continued improvements in our business as vaccines become more widely available, as vaccination rates increase, and as\nconsumers return to many of their previous work routines as well as socializing and traveling. The Company has certain intangible and other long-lived assets that are more\ndependent on cash flows generated in the away-from-home channels and/or that generate cash flows in geographic areas that are more heavily impacted by the COVID-19\npandemic and are therefore more susceptible to impairment. In addition, intangible and other long-lived assets we acquired in recent transactions are naturally more susceptible\nto impairment, because they are recorded at fair value based on recent operating plans and macroeconomic conditions at the time of acquisition. If we had used other\nassumptions and estimates when tests of these assets were performed, impairment charges could have resulted. Furthermore, if management uses different assumptions in future\nperiods, or if different conditions exist in future periods, impairment charges could result. The total future impairment charges we may be required to record could be material.\nRefer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent acquisitions. Refer to Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements for the discussion of impairment charges. Refer to the heading “Operations Review? below for additional information related to our present business environment.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the carrying value of our investment in Coca-Cola Bottlers Japan Holdings Inc. (\"CCBJHI\") exceeded its fair value by $87 million, or 18 percent.\nBased on the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than our carrying value and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time\nsufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value, management determined that the decline in fair value was temporary in nature. Therefore, we did not record an\nimpairment charge related to the investment.\nOur equity method investees also perform such recoverability and impairment tests. If an impairment charge is recorded by one of our equity method investees, the Company\nrecords its proportionate share of such charge as a reduction of equity income (loss) — net in our consolidated statement of income. However, the actual amount we record with\nrespect to our proportionate share of such charge may be impacted by items such as basis differences, deferred taxes and deferred gains.\nInvestmentsinEquityandDebtSecurities\nWe measure all equity investments that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method at fair value with the change in fair value included in\nnet income. We use quoted market prices to determine the fair value of equity securities with readily determinable fair values. For equity securities without readily determinable\nfair values, we have elected the measurement alternative under which we measure these investments at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from\nobservable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. Management assesses each of these investments on an individual\nbasis.\nOur investments in debt securities are carried at either amortized cost or fair value. The cost basis is determined by the specific identification method. Investments in debt\nsecurities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost and classified as held-to-maturity. Investments in debt securities\nthat are not classified as held-to-maturity are carried at fair value and classified as either trading or available-for-sale. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading debt\nsecurities as well as realized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities are included in net income. Unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, on available-for-sale debt\nsecurities are included in our consolidated balance sheet as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), except for the changes in fair values attributable to\nthe currency risk being hedged, if applicable, which are included in net income.\nEquity securities with readily determinable fair values that are not accounted for under the equity method and debt securities classified as trading are not assessed for\nimpairment, since they are carried at fair value with the change in fair value included in net income. Equity method investments, equity securities without readily determinable\nfair values and debt securities classified as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity are reviewed each reporting period to determine whether a significant event or change in\ncircumstances has occurred that may have an adverse effect on the fair value of each investment. When such events or changes occur, we evaluate the fair value compared to\nour cost basis in the investment. We also perform this evaluation every reporting period for each investment for which our cost basis has exceeded the fair value. The fair values\nof most of our Company's investments in publicly traded companies are often readily available based on quoted market prices. For investments in nonpublicly traded\ncompanies, management's assessment of fair value is based on valuation methodologies including discounted cash flows, estimates of sales proceeds and appraisals, as\nappropriate. We consider the assumptions that we believe a market participant would use in evaluating estimated future cash flows when employing the discounted cash flow or\nestimates of sales proceeds valuation methodologies. The ability to accurately predict future cash flows, especially in emerging and developing markets, may impact the\ndetermination of fair value. In the event the fair value of an investment declines below our cost basis, management is required to determine if the decline in fair value is other\nthan temporary. If management determines the decline is other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded. Management's assessment as to the nature of a decline in fair\nvalue is based on, among other things, the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than our cost basis; the financial condition and near-term\nprospects of the issuer; and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.\nProperty,PlantandEquipment\nCertain events or changes in circumstances may indicate that the recoverability of the carrying amount or remaining useful life of property, plant and equipment should be\nassessed, including, among others, the manner or length of time in which the Company intends to use the asset, a significant decrease in market value, a significant change in\nthe business climate in a particular market, or a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with historical losses and/or projected future losses. When such events or\nchanges in circumstances are present and a recoverability test is performed, we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the aset or asset group and its\neventual disposition. These estimated future cash flows are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and\nwithout interest charges) is less than the carrying amount, we recognize an impairment charge. The impairment charge\nrecognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. We use a variety of methodologies to determine the fair value of property, plant and equipment,\nincluding appraisals and discounted cash flow models. These appraisals and models include assumptions we believe are consistent with those a market participant would use.\nGoodwill,TrademarksandOtherIntangibleAssets\nIntangible assets are classified into three categories: (1) intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization; (2) intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to\namortization; and (3) goodwill. For intangible assets with definite lives, recoverability tests must be performed if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be\nrecoverable. For intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill, impairment tests must be performed at least annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances\nindicate that an asset may be impaired.\nThe performance of recoverability and impairment tests of intangible assets involves critical accounting estimates. These estimates require significant management judgment,\ninclude inherent uncertainties and are often interdependent; therefore, they do not change in isolation. Factors that management must estimate include, among others, the\neconomic lives of the assets, sales volume, pricing, royalty rates, cost of raw materials, delivery costs, the impact of any supply chain disruptions, inflation, long-term growth\nrates, cost of capital, marketing spending, foreign currency exchange rates, tax rates, capital spending, proceeds from the sale of assets and customers? financial condition.\nThese factors are even more difficult to predict when global financial markets are highly volatile. The estimates we use when performing recoverability tests of intangible assets\nare consistent with those we use in our internal planning. When performing impairment tests, we estimate the fair values of the assets using management's best assumptions,\nwhich we believe are consistent with those a market participant would use. The estimates and assumptions used in these tests are evaluated and updated as appropriate. The\nvariability of these factors depends on a number of conditions, including uncertainty about future events, and thus our accounting estimates may change from period to period.\nIf other assumptions and estimates had been used when these tests were performed, impairment charges could have resulted. As mentioned above, these factors do not change in\nisolation and, therefore, we do not believe it is practicable or meaningful to present the impact of changing a single factor. Furthermore, if management uses different\nassumptions in future periods or if different conditions exist in future periods, impairment charges could result. Refer to the heading “Operations Review\" below for additional\ninformation related to our present business environment.\nIntangible assets acquired in recent transactions are naturally more susceptible to impairment, because they are recorded at fair value based on recent operating plans and\nmacroeconomic conditions present at the time of acquisition. Consequently, if operating results and/or macroeconomic conditions deteriorate shortly after an acquisition, it\ncould result in the impairment of the acquired assets. A deterioration of macroeconomic conditions may not only negatively impact the estimated operating cash flows used in\nour cash flow models but may also negatively impact other assumptions used in our analyses, including, but not limited to, the estimated cost of capital and/or discount rates.\nAdditionally, we are required to ensure that the assumptions used to determine fair value in our analyses are consistent with the assumptions that we believe a market\nparticipant would use. As a result, the cost of capital and/or discount rates used in our analyses may increase or decrease based on market conditions and trends, regardless of\nwhether our Company's actual cost of capital has changed Therefore, if the cost of capital and/or discount rates change, our Company may recognize an impairment of an\nintangible asset in spite of realizing actual cash flows that are approximately equal to, or greater than, our previously forecasted amounts.\nWe perform impairment tests of goodwill at our reporting unit level, which is generally one level below our operating segments. Our operating segments are primarily based on\ngeographic responsibility, which is consistent with the way management runs our business. Our geographic operating segments are generally subdivided into smaller\ngeographic regions. These geographic regions are our reporting units. Our Global Ventures operating segment includes the results of our Costa, innocent and dogadan\nbusinesses as wellas fees earned pursuant to distribution coordination agreements between the Company and Monster, each of which is its own reporting unit. The Bottling\nInvestments operating segment includes all of our consolidated bottling operations, regardless of geographic location. Generally, each consolidated bottling operation within\nour Bottling Investments operating segment is its own reporting unit. Goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit or units that benefit from the synergies arising from each\nbusinesscombination.\nIn order to test for goodwill impairment, the Company compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting\nunit is less than its carrying amount, goodwill is written down for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value. However, the impairment\ncharge recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. We typically use discounted cash flow models to determine the fair value of a reporting unit. The\nassumptions used in these models are consistent with those we believe a market participant would use. The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment of\ngoodwill rather than completing the impairment test. The Company must assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying\namount. If the Company concludes that this is the case, it must perform the impairment testing discussed above. Otherwise, the Company does not need to perform any further\nassessment.\nWhen events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of definite-lived intangible assets may not be recoverable, management performs a recoverability test of the\ncarrying value by preparing estimates of sales volume and the resulting gross profit and cash flows. These estimated future cash flows are consistent with those we use in our\ninternal planning. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group, we\nrecognize an impairment charge. The impairment charge recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. We use a variety of methodologies to\ndetermine the fair value of these assets, including discounted cash flow models. These models include assumptions we believe are consistent with those a market participant\nWwoulduse.\nWe test indefinite-lived intangible assets, including trademarks, franchise rights and goodwill, for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate\nthat an asset may be impaired. Our Company performs these annual impairment tests as of the first day of our third fiscal quarter. We use a variety of methodologies in\nconducting impairment tests of indefinite-lived intangible assets, including, but not limited to, discounted cash flow models. These models include assumptions we believe are\nconsistent with those a market participant would use. For indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than goodwill, if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment\ncharge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than\ngoodwill, rather than completing the impairment test. The Company must assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its\ncarrying amount. If the Company concludes that this is the case, it must perform the impairment testing described above. Otherwise, the Company does not need to perform any\nfurther assessment.",

        "content": "ShippingandHandlingCosts\nShipping and handling costs related to the movement of goods from our manufacturing locations to our sales distribution centers are included in the line item cost of goods sold\nin our consolidated statement of income. Shipping and handling costs incurred to move goods from our manufacturing locations or sales distribution centers to our customers\nare also included in the line itm cost of goods sold in our consolidated statement ofincome xcept for costs incurred todistribute goods sold by our consolidated botles t\nour customers, which are included in the line item selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of income. Our customers generally do not pay us\nseparately for shipping and handling costs. We recognize the cost of shipping and handling activities that are performed after a customer obtains control of the goods as costs to\nfulfill our promise to provide goods to the customer. As a result of this election, the Company does not evaluate whether shipping and handling activities are services promised\nto customers. If revenue is recognized for the related goods before the shipping and handling activities occur, the related costs of those shipping and handling activities are\nacrued.\nSales,Use,Value-Added and ExciseTaxes\nThe Company collects taxes imposed directly on its customers related to sales, use, value-added, excise and other similar taxes. The Company then remits such taxes on behalf\nof its customers to the applicable governmental authorities. We exclude from net operating revenues the tax amounts imposed on revenue-producing transactions that were\ncollected from our customers to be remitted to governmental authorities. Accordingly, such tax amounts are recorded in the line item trade accounts receivable in our\nconsolidated balance sheet when collection of taxes from the customer has not yet occurred and are recorded in the line item accounts payable and accrued expenses in our\nconsolidated balance sheet until they are remitted to the applicable governmental authorities. Taxes imposed directly on the Company, whether based on receipts from sales,\ninventory procurement costs or manufacturing activities, are recorded in the line item cost of goods sold in our consolidated statement of income.\nNetIncomePerShare\nBasic net income per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to shareowners of The Coca-Cola Company by the weighted-average number of common shares\noutstanding during the reporting period. Diluted net income per share is computed similarly to basic net income per share, except that it includes the potential dilution that\ncould occur if dilutive securities were exercised. Approximately 6 million stock options were excluded from the computation of diluted net income per share in both 2021 and\n2020 because the stock options would have been antidilutive. The number of stock options excluded from the computation of diluted net income per share in 2019 was\ninsignificant.\nCash,Cash Equivalents,Restricted Cash and Restricted Cash Equivalents\nWe classify time deposits and other investments that are highly liquid and have maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase as cash equivalents or restricted cash\nequivalents, as applicable. Restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents generally consist of amounts held by our captive insurance companies, which are included in the line\nitem other noncurent\nassets on our consolidated balance sheet. We manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific minimum credit standards, diversification of counterparties and\nprocedures to monitor our concentrations of credit risk.\nThe following table provides a summary of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents that constitute the total amounts shown in our consolidated\nstatements of cash flows (in millions):",

Likewise, when we use the capitalized word “Trademark” together with the name of one of our other beverage products (such as “Trademark Fanta,\"\n\"Trademark Sprite” or “Trademark Simply\"), we mean beverages bearing the indicated trademark (that is, Fanta, Sprite or Simply, respectively) and all its variations and\nline extensions (such that “Trademark Fanta” includes Fanta Orange, Fanta Zero Orange, Fanta Zero Sugar, Fanta Apple, etc.; “Trademark Sprite” includes Sprite, Sprite\nZero Sugar, etc.; and \"Trademark Simply”' includes Simply Orange, Simply Apple, Simply Grapefruit, etc.).\nOur Company markets, manufactures and sells:\n· beverage concentrates, sometimes referred to as “beverage bases,” and syrups, including fountain syrups (we refer to this part of our business as our “concentrate\noperations\"); and\n· finished sparkling soft drinks and other beverages (we refer to this part of our business as our “finished product operations\").\nGenerally, finished product operations generate higher net operating revenues but lower gross profit margins than concentrate operations.\nOur concentrate operations typically generate net operating revenues by selling concentrates, syrups and certain finished beverages to authorized bottling operations (to which\nwe typically refer as our “bottlers” or our *\"bottling partners\"). Our bottling partners either combine concentrates with still or sparkling water and sweeteners (depending on the\nproduct), or combine syrups with still or sparkling water, to produce finished beverages. The finished beverages are packaged in authorized containers, such as cans and\nrefillable and nonrefillable glass and plastic bottles, bearing our trademarks or trademarks licensed to us and are then sold to retailers directly or, in some cases, through\nwholesalers or other bottlers. In addition, outside the United States, our bottling partners are typically authorized to manufacture fountain syrups, using our concentrates, which\nthey sell to fountain retailers for use in producing beverages for immediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers who in turn sell and distribute the fountain\nsyrups to fountain retailers. Our concentrate operations are included in our geographic operating segments and our Global Ventures operating segment.\nOur finished product operations generate net operating revenues by selling sparkling soft drinks and a variety of other finished beverages to retailers or to distributors and\nwholesalers who in turn sell the beverages to retailers. These operations consist primarily of our consolidated bottling and distribution operations, which are included in our\nBottling Investments operating segment. In certain markets, the Company also operates non-bottling finished product operations in which we sell finished beverages to\ndistributors and wholesalers that are generally not one of the Company's bottling partners. These operations are generally included in one of our geographic operating segments\nor our Global Ventures operating segment. Additionally, we sell directly to consumers through retail stores operated by Costa Limited (*\"Costa\"). These sales are included in our\nGlobal Ventures operating segmet. I theUnited States, wemanufacturefoutain syrups and sellthmto fountainetailers whouse thefoutain syrups to produce everages\nfor immediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers or bottling partners who in turn sell the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. These fountain syrup sales are\nincluded in our North America operating segment.\nFor information regarding net operating revenues and unit case volume related to our concentrate operations and finished product operations, refer to the heading “Our\nBusiness -- General' set forth in Part I, “Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\"? of this report.\nFor information regarding how we measure the volume of Company beverage products sold by the Company and our bottling partners (\"Coca-Cola system\"), refer to the\nheading “Operations Review —- Beverage Volume” set forth in Part I, “Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\"” of\nthisreport.\nWe own and market numerous valuable beverage brands, including the following:\n° sparkling soft drinks: Coca-Cola, Diet Coke/Coca-Cola Light, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, Fanta, Fresca, Schweppes, Sprite and Thums Up;\nhydration, sports, coffe and tea: Aquarius, Ayataka, BODYARMOR, Ciel, Costa, dogadan, Dasani, FUZE TEA, Georgia, glaceau smartwater, glaceau vitaminwater,\nGold Peak, Ice Dew, I LOHAS, Powerade and Topo Chico; and\nnutrition, juice, dairy and plant-based beverages: AdeS, Del Valle, fairlife, innocent, Minute Maid, Minute Maid Pulpy and Simply.\nISchweppes is owned by the Company in certain countries other than the United States.\nIn addition to the beverage brands we own, we also provide marketing support and otherwise participate in the sales of other beverage brands through licenses, joint ventures\nand strategic partnerships.

Likewise, when we use the capitalized word “Trademark” together with the name of one of our other beverage products (such as “Trademark\nFanta,” “Trademark Sprite” or “Trademark Simply\"), we mean beverages bearing the indicated trademark (that is, Fanta, Sprite or Simply, respectively) and all its\nvariations and line extensions (such that *Trademark Fanta” includes Fanta Orange, Fanta Zero Orange, Fanta Zero Sugar, Fanta Apple, etc.; Trademark Sprite'\nincludes Sprite, Sprite Zero Sugar, etc.; and *Trademark Simply” includes Simply Orange, Simply Apple, Simply Grapefruit, etc.).\n?\nOur Company markets, manufactures and sells:\n· beverage concentrates, sometimes referred to as “beverage bases,” and syrups, including fountain syrups (we refer to this part of our business as our “concentrate\noperations\");and\n· finished sparkling soft drinks and other beverages (we refer to this part of our business as our “finished product operations\").\nGenerally, finished product operations generate higher net operating revenues but lower gross profit margins than concentrate operations.\nOur concentrate operations typically generate net operating revenues by selling concentrates, syrups and certain finished beverages to authorized bottling operations (to which\nwe typically refer as our “bottlers\" or our *bottling partners\"). Our bottling partners either combine concentrates with still or sparkling water and sweeteners (depending on the\nproduct), or combine syrups with still or sparkling water, to produce finished beverages. The finished beverages are packaged in authorized containers, such as cans and\nrefillable and nonrefillable glass and plastic bottles, bearing our trademarks or trademarks licensed to us and are then sold to retailers directly or, in some cases, through\nwholesalers or other bottlers. In addition, outside the United States, our bottling partners are typically authorized to manufacture fountain syrups, using our concentrates, which\nthey sell to fountain retailers for use in producing beverages for immediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers who in turn sell and distribute the fountain\nsyrups to fountain retailers. Our concentrate operations are included in our geographic operating segments and our Global Ventures operating segment.\nOur finished product operations generate net operating revenues by selling sparkling soft drinks and a variety of other finished beverages to retailers or to distributors and\nwholesalers who in turn sell the beverages to retailers. These operations consist primarily of our consolidated bottling and distribution operations, which are included in our\nBottling Investments operating segment. In certain markets, the Company also operates non-bottling finished product operations in which we sell finished beverages to\ndistributors and wholesalers that are generally not one of the Company's bottling partners. These operations are generally included in one of our geographic operating segments\nor our Global Ventures operating segment. Additionally, we sell directly to consumers through retail stores operated by Costa Limited (\"Costa\"). These sales are included in our\nGlobal Ventures operating segment In the United States, we manufacture fountain syrups and sell them to fountain retailers, whouse the fountain syrups to produce beverages\nfor immediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers or bottling partners who in turn sell the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. These fountain syrup sales are\nincluded in our North America operating segment.\nFor information regarding net operating revenues and unit case volume related to our concentrate operations and finished product operations, refer to the heading “Our\nBusiness —- General\" set forth in Part II, “Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" of this report.\nFor information regarding how we measure the volume of Company beverage products sold by the Company and our bottling partners (*Coca-Cola system), refer to the\nheading “Operations Review — Beverage Volume” set forth in Part II, “Item 7.

        "content": "2 The increase was primarily related to a change in judgment about the Company's tax positions with several foreign jurisdictions.\n3 The decrease was primarily related to a change in judgment about one of the Company's tax positions that became certain as a result of settlement of a matter in the United States.\nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the line item income taxes on our consolidated statement of income. The Company had\n$453 million, $391 million and $201 million in interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits accrued as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Of\nthese amounts, expense of $62 million, $190 million and $11 million was recognized in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively If the Company were to prevail on all uncertain tax\npositions, the reversal of this accrual would be a benefit to the Company's effective tax rate.\nIt is expected that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change in the next 12 months; however, we do not expect any changes will have a significant impact on our\nconsolidated statement of income or consolidated balance sheet. These changes may be the result of settlements of ongoing audits, statute of limitations expiring or final\nsettlements in transfer pricing matters that are the subject of litigation. Currently, an estimate of the range of the reasonably possible outcomes cannot be made.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $2,313 million of loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income. Loss carryforwards of $849 million must be utilized within\nthe next five years, and the remainder can be utilized over a period greater than five years.\nAn analysis of our deferred tax asset valuation allowances is as follows (in millions):\nThe Company's deferred tax asset valuation allowances are primarily the result of uncertainties regarding the future realization of recorded tax benefits on tax loss\ncarryforwards and foreign tax credit carryforwards from operations in various jurisdictions and basis differences in certain equity investments. Current evidence does not\nsuggest we will realize sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character within the carryforward period to allow us to realize these deferred tax benefits. If we were to\nidentify and implement tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or generate sufficient income of the appropriate character in these jurisdictions in the future,\nit could lead to the reversal of these valuation allowances and a reduction of income tax expense. The Company believes that it will generate sufficient future taxable income to\nrealize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets in our consolidated balance sheet.\nIn 2021, the Company recognized a net decrease of $5 million in its valuation allowances. The decrease was primarily due to net decreases in the deferred tax assets and related\nvaluation allowances on certain equity investments and the changes in net operating losses in the normal course of business.\nIn 2020, the Company recognized a net increase of $103 million in its valuation allowances. The increase was primarily due to net increases in the deferred tax assets and\nrelated valuation allowances on certain equity investments. The increase was also due to the increase of valuation allowances after considering significant negative evidence on\nthe utilization of certain net operating losses and excess foreign tax credits.\nIn 2019, the Company recognized a net decrease of $116 million in its valuation allowances. This decrease was primarily due to the reversal of a valuation allowance after\nconsidering significant positive evidence on the utilization of certain net operating losses. This decrease was also due to the reversal of a valuation allowance in our U.S.\noperations related to expenses that were previously determined to be nondeductible and the changes in net operating losses in the normal course of business. The decrease was\npartially offset by an increase in the valuation allowance due to increases in the deferred tax assets and related valuation allowances on certain equity method investments and\nan increase due to the acquisition of foreign operations.\nNOTE15:OTHERCOMPREHENSIVEINCOME\nAOCI attributable to shareowners of The Coca-Cola Company is separately presented in our consolidated balance sheet as a component of The Coca-Cola Company's\nshareowners equity, which also includes our proportionate share of equity method investees' AOCI.

        "content": "RecoverabilityofCurrent andNoncurrentAssets\nOur Company faces many uncertainties and risks related to various economic, political and regulatory environments in the countries in which we operate, particularly in\ndeveloping and emerging markets. Refer to the heading “Our Business — Challenges and Risks\"” above and “Item 1A. Risk Factors\" in Part I of this report. As a result,\nmanagement must make numerous assumptions, which involve a significant amount of judgment, when performing recoverability and impairment tests of current and\nnoncurrent assets in various regions around the world.\nWe perform recoverability and impairment tests of current and noncurrent assets in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For certain assets, recoverability and/or impairment tests are\nrequired only when conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. For other assets, impairment tests are required at least annually, or more frequently\nif events or circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired.\nThe performance of recoverability and impairment tests of current and noncurrent assets involves critical accounting estimates. These estimates require significant management\njudgment, include inherent uncertainties and are often interdependent; therefore, they do not change in isolation. Factors that management must estimate include, among others,\nthe economic lives of the assets, sales volume, pricing, royalty rates, cost of raw materials, delivery costs, the impact of any supply chain disruptions, inflation, long-term\ngrowth rates, cost of capital, marketing spending, foreign currency exchange rates, tax rates, capital spending, proceeds from the sale of assets and customers? financial\ncondition. These factors are even more difficult to estimate as a result of uncertainties associated with the scope, severity and duration of the global COVID-19 pandemic and\nany resurgences of the pandemic, including, but not limited to, the number of people contracting the virus; the impact of shelter-in-place and social distancing requirements; the\nimpact of governmental actions across the globe to contain the virus; vaccine availability, rates of vaccination and effectiveness of vaccines against existing and new variants of\nthe virus; governmental or other vaccine mandates and any associated business and supply chain disruptions; and the substance and pace of the economic recovery. The\nestimates we use when performing recoverability tests of assets are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. When performing impairment tests, we estimate the\nfair values of the assets using management's best assumptions, which we believe are consistent with those a market participant would use The variability of these factors\ndepends on a number of conditions, including uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, and thus our accounting estimates may change from period to period.\nWhile uncertainties still exist, we expect to see continued improvements in our business as vaccines become more widely available, as vaccination rates increase, and as\nconsumers return to many of their previous work routines as well as socializing and traveling. The Company has certain intangible and other long-lived assets that are more\ndependent on cash flows generated in the away-from-home channels and/or that generate cash flows in geographic areas that are more heavily impacted by the COVID-19\npandemic and are therefore more susceptible to impairment. In addition, intangible and other long-lived assets we acquired in recent transactions are naturally more susceptible\nto impairment, because they are recorded at fair value based on recent operating plans and macroeconomic conditions at the time of acquisition. If we had used other\nassumptions and estimates when tests of these assets were performed, impairment charges could have resulted. Furthermore, if management uses different assumptions in future\nperiods, or if different conditions exist in future periods, impairment charges could result. The total future impairment charges we may be required to record could be material.\nRefer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent acquisitions. Refer to Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements for the discussion of impairment charges. Refer to the heading “Operations Review? below for additional information related to our present business environment.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the carrying value of our investment in Coca-Cola Bottlers Japan Holdings Inc. (\"CCBJHI\") exceeded its fair value by $87 million, or 18 percent.\nBased on the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than our carrying value and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time\nsufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value, management determined that the decline in fair value was temporary in nature. Therefore, we did not record an\nimpairment charge related to the investment.\nOur equity method investees also perform such recoverability and impairment tests. If an impairment charge is recorded by one of our equity method investees, the Company\nrecords its proportionate share of such charge as a reduction of equity income (loss) — net in our consolidated statement of income. However, the actual amount we record with\nrespect to our proportionate share of such charge may be impacted by items such as basis differences, deferred taxes and deferred gains.\nInvestmentsinEquityandDebtSecurities\nWe measure all equity investments that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method at fair value with the change in fair value included in\nnet income. We use quoted market prices to determine the fair value of equity securities with readily determinable fair values. For equity securities without readily determinable\nfair values, we have elected the measurement alternative under which we measure these investments at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from\nobservable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. Management assesses each of these investments on an individual\nbasis.\nOur investments in debt securities are carried at either amortized cost or fair value. The cost basis is determined by the specific identification method. Investments in debt\nsecurities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost and classified as held-to-maturity. Investments in debt securities\nthat are not classified as held-to-maturity are carried at fair value and classified as either trading or available-for-sale. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading debt\nsecurities as well as realized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities are included in net income. Unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, on available-for-sale debt\nsecurities are included in our consolidated balance sheet as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), except for the changes in fair values attributable to\nthe currency risk being hedged, if applicable, which are included in net income.\nEquity securities with readily determinable fair values that are not accounted for under the equity method and debt securities classified as trading are not assessed for\nimpairment, since they are carried at fair value with the change in fair value included in net income. Equity method investments, equity securities without readily determinable\nfair values and debt securities classified as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity are reviewed each reporting period to determine whether a significant event or change in\ncircumstances has occurred that may have an adverse effect on the fair value of each investment. When such events or changes occur, we evaluate the fair value compared to\nour cost basis in the investment. We also perform this evaluation every reporting period for each investment for which our cost basis has exceeded the fair value. The fair values\nof most of our Company's investments in publicly traded companies are often readily available based on quoted market prices. For investments in nonpublicly traded\ncompanies, management's assessment of fair value is based on valuation methodologies including discounted cash flows, estimates of sales proceeds and appraisals, as\nappropriate. We consider the assumptions that we believe a market participant would use in evaluating estimated future cash flows when employing the discounted cash flow or\nestimates of sales proceeds valuation methodologies. The ability to accurately predict future cash flows, especially in emerging and developing markets, may impact the\ndetermination of fair value. In the event the fair value of an investment declines below our cost basis, management is required to determine if the decline in fair value is other\nthan temporary. If management determines the decline is other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded. Management's assessment as to the nature of a decline in fair\nvalue is based on, among other things, the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than our cost basis; the financial condition and near-term\nprospects of the issuer; and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.\nProperty,PlantandEquipment\nCertain events or changes in circumstances may indicate that the recoverability of the carrying amount or remaining useful life of property, plant and equipment should be\nassessed, including, among others, the manner or length of time in which the Company intends to use the asset, a significant decrease in market value, a significant change in\nthe business climate in a particular market, or a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with historical losses and/or projected future losses. When such events or\nchanges in circumstances are present and a recoverability test is performed, we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the aset or asset group and its\neventual disposition. These estimated future cash flows are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and\nwithout interest charges) is less than the carrying amount, we recognize an impairment charge. The impairment charge\nrecognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. We use a variety of methodologies to determine the fair value of property, plant and equipment,\nincluding appraisals and discounted cash flow models. These appraisals and models include assumptions we believe are consistent with those a market participant would use.\nGoodwill,TrademarksandOtherIntangibleAssets\nIntangible assets are classified into three categories: (1) intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization; (2) intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to\namortization; and (3) goodwill. For intangible assets with definite lives, recoverability tests must be performed if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be\nrecoverable. For intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill, impairment tests must be performed at least annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances\nindicate that an asset may be impaired.\nThe performance of recoverability and impairment tests of intangible assets involves critical accounting estimates. These estimates require significant management judgment,\ninclude inherent uncertainties and are often interdependent; therefore, they do not change in isolation. Factors that management must estimate include, among others, the\neconomic lives of the assets, sales volume, pricing, royalty rates, cost of raw materials, delivery costs, the impact of any supply chain disruptions, inflation, long-term growth\nrates, cost of capital, marketing spending, foreign currency exchange rates, tax rates, capital spending, proceeds from the sale of assets and customers? financial condition.\nThese factors are even more difficult to predict when global financial markets are highly volatile. The estimates we use when performing recoverability tests of intangible assets\nare consistent with those we use in our internal planning. When performing impairment tests, we estimate the fair values of the assets using management's best assumptions,\nwhich we believe are consistent with those a market participant would use. The estimates and assumptions used in these tests are evaluated and updated as appropriate. The\nvariability of these factors depends on a number of conditions, including uncertainty about future events, and thus our accounting estimates may change from period to period.\nIf other assumptions and estimates had been used when these tests were performed, impairment charges could have resulted. As mentioned above, these factors do not change in\nisolation and, therefore, we do not believe it is practicable or meaningful to present the impact of changing a single factor. Furthermore, if management uses different\nassumptions in future periods or if different conditions exist in future periods, impairment charges could result. Refer to the heading “Operations Review\" below for additional\ninformation related to our present business environment.\nIntangible assets acquired in recent transactions are naturally more susceptible to impairment, because they are recorded at fair value based on recent operating plans and\nmacroeconomic conditions present at the time of acquisition. Consequently, if operating results and/or macroeconomic conditions deteriorate shortly after an acquisition, it\ncould result in the impairment of the acquired assets. A deterioration of macroeconomic conditions may not only negatively impact the estimated operating cash flows used in\nour cash flow models but may also negatively impact other assumptions used in our analyses, including, but not limited to, the estimated cost of capital and/or discount rates.\nAdditionally, we are required to ensure that the assumptions used to determine fair value in our analyses are consistent with the assumptions that we believe a market\nparticipant would use. As a result, the cost of capital and/or discount rates used in our analyses may increase or decrease based on market conditions and trends, regardless of\nwhether our Company's actual cost of capital has changed Therefore, if the cost of capital and/or discount rates change, our Company may recognize an impairment of an\nintangible asset in spite of realizing actual cash flows that are approximately equal to, or greater than, our previously forecasted amounts.\nWe perform impairment tests of goodwill at our reporting unit level, which is generally one level below our operating segments. Our operating segments are primarily based on\ngeographic responsibility, which is consistent with the way management runs our business. Our geographic operating segments are generally subdivided into smaller\ngeographic regions. These geographic regions are our reporting units. Our Global Ventures operating segment includes the results of our Costa, innocent and dogadan\nbusinesses as wellas fees earned pursuant to distribution coordination agreements between the Company and Monster, each of which is its own reporting unit. The Bottling\nInvestments operating segment includes all of our consolidated bottling operations, regardless of geographic location. Generally, each consolidated bottling operation within\nour Bottling Investments operating segment is its own reporting unit. Goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit or units that benefit from the synergies arising from each\nbusinesscombination.\nIn order to test for goodwill impairment, the Company compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting\nunit is less than its carrying amount, goodwill is written down for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value. However, the impairment\ncharge recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. We typically use discounted cash flow models to determine the fair value of a reporting unit. The\nassumptions used in these models are consistent with those we believe a market participant would use. The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment of\ngoodwill rather than completing the impairment test. The Company must assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying\namount. If the Company concludes that this is the case, it must perform the impairment testing discussed above. Otherwise, the Company does not need to perform any further\nassessment.\nWhen events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of definite-lived intangible assets may not be recoverable, management performs a recoverability test of the\ncarrying value by preparing estimates of sales volume and the resulting gross profit and cash flows. These estimated future cash flows are consistent with those we use in our\ninternal planning. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group, we\nrecognize an impairment charge. The impairment charge recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. We use a variety of methodologies to\ndetermine the fair value of these assets, including discounted cash flow models. These models include assumptions we believe are consistent with those a market participant\nWwoulduse.\nWe test indefinite-lived intangible assets, including trademarks, franchise rights and goodwill, for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate\nthat an asset may be impaired. Our Company performs these annual impairment tests as of the first day of our third fiscal quarter. We use a variety of methodologies in\nconducting impairment tests of indefinite-lived intangible assets, including, but not limited to, discounted cash flow models. These models include assumptions we believe are\nconsistent with those a market participant would use. For indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than goodwill, if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment\ncharge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than\ngoodwill, rather than completing the impairment test. The Company must assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its\ncarrying amount. If the Company concludes that this is the case, it must perform the impairment testing described above. Otherwise, the Company does not need to perform any\nfurther assessment.",

        "content": "RecoverabilityofCurrent andNoncurrentAssets\nOur Company faces many uncertainties and risks related to various economic, political and regulatory environments in the countries and territories in which we operate,\nparticularly in developing and emerging markets. Refer to the heading “Our Business — Challenges and Risks\" above and “Item 1A. Risk Factors\" in Part I of this report. As a\nresult, management must make numerous assumptions, which involve a significant amount of judgment, when performing recoverability and impairment tests of current and\nnoncurent assets in various regions around the world.\nWe perform recoverability and impairment tests of current and noncurrent assets in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For certain assets, recoverability and/or impairment tests are\nrequired only when conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. For other assets, impairment tests are required at least annually, or more frequently\nif events or circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired.\nThe performance of recoverability and impairment tests of current and noncurrent assets involves critical accounting estimates. These estimates require significant management\njudgment, include inherent uncertainties and are often interdependent; therefore, they do not change in isolation. Factors that management must estimate include, among others,\nthe economic lives of the assets, sales volume, pricing, royalty rates, cost of raw materials, delivery costs, the impact of any supply chain disruptions, inflation, long-term\ngrowth rates, cost of capital, marketing spending, foreign currency exchange rates, tax rates, capital spending, proceeds from the sale of assets and customers? financial\ncondition. The variability of these factors depends on a number of conditions, and thus our accounting estimates may change from period to period. These factors are even more\ndifficult to estimate as a result of uncertainties associated with the scope, severity and duration of the global COVID-19 pandemic. The estimates we use when performing\nrecoverability tests of assets are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. When performing impairment tests, we estimate the fair values of the assets using\nmanagement's best assumptions, which we believe are consistent with those a market participant would use. The Company has certain intangible and other long-lived assets\nthat are more dependent on cash flows generated in away-from-home channels and/or that generate cash flows in geographic areas which are more heavily impacted by the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, and therefore these assets are more susceptible to impairment. In addition, intangible and other long-lived assets we acquired in recent transactions are\nnaturally more susceptible to impairment, because they are recorded at fair value based on recent operating plans and macroeconomic conditions at the time of acquisition. If\nwe had used other assumptions and estimates when impairment tests were performed, impairment charges could have resulted. Furthermore, if management uses different\nassumptions in future periods, or if different conditions exist in future periods, impairment charges could result. The total future impairment charges we may be required to\nrecord could be material. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent acquisitions. Refer to Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements for the discussion of impairment charges. Refer to the heading “Operations Review? below for additional information related to our present business\nenvironment.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the carrying value of our investment in Coca-Cola Bottlers Japan Holdings Inc. (*\"CCBJHI\") exceeded its fair value by $29 million, or 8 percent.\nBased on the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than our carrying value and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time\nsufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value, management determined that the decline in fair value was temporary in nature. Therefore, we did not record an\nimpairment charge related to the investment.\nOur equity method investees also perform such recoverability and impairment tests. If an impairment charge is recorded by one of our equity method investes, the Company\nrecords its proportionate share of such charge as a reduction of equity income (loss) — net in our consolidated statement of income. However, the actual amount we record with\nrespect to our proportionate share of such charge may be impacted by items such as basis differences, deferred taxes and deferred gains.\nInvestmentsinEquityandDebtSecurities\nWe measure all equity investments that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method at fair value with the change in fair value included in\nnet income. We use quoted market prices to determine the fair value of equity securities with readily determinable fair values. For equity securities without readily determinable\nfair values, we have elected the measurement lternative under which we measure these investments at cost minus impairment, i any, plus or minus changes resulting from\nobservable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. Management assesses each of these investments on an individual\nbasis.\nOur investments in debt securities are carried at either amortized cost or fair value. The cost basis is determined by the specific identification method. Investments in debt\nsecurities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost and classified as held-to-maturity. Investments in debt securities\nthat are not classified as held-to-maturity are carried at fair value and classified as either trading or available-for-sale. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading debt\nsecurities as well as realized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities are included in net income. Unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, on available-for-sale debt\nsecurities are included in our consolidated balance sheet as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), except for the changes in fair values attributable to\nthe currency risk being hedged, if applicable, which are included in net income.\nEquity securities with readily determinable fair values that are not accounted for under the equity method and debt securities classified as trading are not assessed for\nimpairment, since they are carried at fair value with the change in fair value included in net income. Equity method investments, equity securities without readily determinable\nfair values and debt securities classified as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity are reviewed each reporting period to determine whether a significant event or change in\ncircumstances has occured that may have an adverse effect on the fair value of each investment. When such events or changes occur, we evaluate the fair value compared to\nour cost basis in the investment. We also perform this evaluation every reporting period for each investment for which our cost basis has exceeded the fair value. The fair values\nof most of our Company's investments in publicly traded companies are often readily available based on quoted market prices. For investments in nonpublicly traded\ncompanies, management's assessment of fair value is based on various valuation methodologies, including discounted cash flows, estimates of sales proceeds, and appraisals, as\nappropriate. We consider the assumptions that we believe a market participant would use in evaluating estimated future cash flows when employing the discounted cash flow or\nestimates of sales proceeds valuation methodologies. The ability to accurately predict future cash flows, especially in emerging and developing markets, may impact the\ndetermination of fair value. In the event the fair value of an investment declines below our cost basis, management is required to determine if the decline in fair value is other\nthan temporary. If management determines the decline is other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded. Management's assessment as to the nature of a decline in fair\nvalue is based on, among other things, the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than our cost basis; the financial condition and near-term\nprospects of the issuer; and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.\nProperty,PlantandEquipment\nCertain events or changes in circumstances may indicate that the recoverability of the carrying amount or remaining useful life of property, plant and equipment should be\nassessed, including, among others, the manner or length of time in which the Company intends to use the asset, a significant decrease in market value, a significant change in\nthe business climate in a particular market, or a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with historical losses and/or projected future losses. When such events or\nchanges in circumstances are present and a recoverability test is performed, we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset or asset group and its\neventual disposition. These estimated future cash flows are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and\nwithout interest charges) is less than the carrying amount, we recognize an impairment charge. The impairment charge recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount\nexceeds the fair value. We use a variety of methodologies to determine the fair value of property, plant and equipment, including appraisals and discounted cash flow models.\nThese appraisals and models include assumptions we believe are consistent with those a market participant would use.\nGoodwill,TrademarksandOtherIntangibleAssets\nIntangible assets are classified into three categories: (1) intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization; (2) intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to\namortization; and (3) goodwill. For intangible assets with definite lives, recoverability tests must be performed if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be\nrecoverable. For intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill, impairment tests must be performed at least annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances\nindicate that an asset may be impaired.\nThe performance of recoverability and impairment tests of intangible assets involves critical accounting estimates. These estimates require significant management judgment,\ninclude inherent uncertainties and are often interdependent; therefore, they do not change in isolation. Factors that management must estimate include, among others, the\neconomic lives of the assets, sales volume, pricing, royalty rates, cost of raw materials, delivery costs, the impact of any supply chain disruptions, inflation, long-term growth\nrates, cost of capital, marketing spending, foreign currency exchange rates, tax rates, capital spending, proceeds from the sale of assets and customers financial condition.\nThese factors are even more difficult to predict when global financial markets are highly volatile. The estimates we use when performing recoverability tests of intangible assets\nare consistent with those we use in our internal planning. When performing impairment tests, we estimate the fair values of the assets using management's best assumptions,\nwhich we believe are consistent with those a market participant would use. The estimates and assumptions used in these tests are evaluated and updated as appropriate. The\nvariability of these factors depends on a number\nof conditions, including uncertainty about future events, and thus our accounting estimates may change from period to period. If other assumptions and estimates had been used\nwhen these tests were performed, impairment charges could have resulted. As mentioned above, these factors do not change in isolation and, therefore, we do not believe it is\npracticable or meaningful to present the impact of changing a single factor. Furthermore, if management uses different assumptions in future periods or if different conditions\nexist in future periods, impairment charges could result. Refer to the heading “Operations Review? below for additional information related to our present business\nenvironment.\nIntangible assets acquired in recent transactions are naturally more susceptible to impairment, because they are recorded at fair value based on recent operating plans and\nmacroeconomic conditions present at the time of acquisition. Consequently, if operating results and/or macroeconomic conditions deteriorate shortly after an acquisition, it\ncould result in the impairment of the acquired assets. A deterioration of macroeconomic conditions may not only negatively impact the estimated operating cash flows used in\nour cash flow models but may also negatively impact other assumptions used in our analyses, including, but not limited to, the estimated cost of capital and/or discount rates.\nAdditionally, we are required to ensure that the assumptions used to determine fair value in our analyses are consistent with the asumptions that we believe a market\nparticipant would use. As a result, the cost of capital and/or discount rates used in our analyses may increase or decrease based on market conditions and trends, regardless of\nwhether our Company's actual cost of capital has changed. Therefore, if the cost of capital and/or discount rates change, our Company may recognize an impairment of an\nintangible asset in spite of realizing actual cash flows that are equal to, or greater than, our previously forecasted amounts.\nWe perform impairment tests of goodwill at our reporting unit level, which is generally one level below our operating segments. Our operating segments are primarily based on\ngeographic responsibility, which is consistent with the way management runs our business. Our geographic operating segments are generally subdivided into smaller\ngeographic regions. These geographic regions are our reporting units. Our Global Ventures operating segment includes the results of our Costa, innocent and dogadan\nbusinesses, as well as fes earned pursuant to distribution coordination agreements between the Company and Monster, each of which is its own reporting unit. The Bottling\nInvestments operating segment includes all of our consolidated bottling operations, regardless of geographic location. Generally, each consolidated bottling operation within\nour Bottling Investments operating segment is its own reporting unit. Goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit or units that benefit from the synergies arising from each\nbusinesscombination.\nIn order to test for goodwill impairment, the Company compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting\nunit is less than its carrying amount, goodwill is written down for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value. However, the impairment\ncharge recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. We typically use discounted cash flow models to determine the fair value of a reporting unit. The\nassumptions used in these models are consistent with those we believe a market participant would use. The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment of\ngoodwill rather than completing the impairment test. The Company must assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying\namount. If the Company concludes that this is the case, it must perform the impairment testing discussed above. Otherwise, the Company does not need to perform any further\nassessment.\nWhen events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of definite-lived intangible assets may not be recoverable, management performs a recoverability test of the\ncarrying value by preparing estimates of sales volume and the resulting gross profit and cash flows. These estimated future cash flows are consistent with those we use in our\ninternal planning. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group, we\nrecognize an impairment charge. The impairment charge recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. We use a variety of methodologies to\ndetermine the fair value of these assets, including discounted cash flow models. These models include assumptions we believe are consistent with those a market participant\nwould use.\nWe test indefinite-lived intangible assets, including trademarks, franchise rights and goodwill, for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate\nthat an asset may be impaired. Our Company performs these annual impairment tests as of the first day of our third fiscal quarter. We use a variety of methodologies in\nconducting impairment tests of indefinite-lived intangible assets, including, but not limited to, discounted cash flow models. These models include assumptions we believe are\nconsistent with those a market participant would use. For indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than goodwill, if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment\ncharge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than\ngoodwill, rather than completing the impairment test. The Company must assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its\ncarrying amount. If the Company concludes that this is the case, it must perform the impairment testing described above. Otherwise, the Company does not need to perform any\nfurther assessment.",

We are aware that some consumers have concerns and negative viewpoints regarding certain\ningredients used in our products. The Coca-Cola system works every day to share safe and refreshing beverages with consumers around the world. We have rigorous product\nand ingredient safety and quality standards designed to ensure safety and quality in each of our products, and we drive innovation that provides new beverage options to satisfy\nconsumers? evolving needs and preferences.\nWe work to ensure consistent safety and quality through strong governance and compliance with applicable regulations and standards. We stay current with new regulations,\nindustry best practices and marketplace conditions, and we engage with standard-setting and industry organizations. Additionally, we manufacture and distribute our products\naccording to strict policies, requirements and specifications set forth in an integrated quality management program that continually measures all operations within the Coca-\nCola system against the same stringent standards. Our quality management program also identifies and mitigates risks and drives improvement. In our quality laboratories, we\nstringently measure the quality attributes of ingredients as well as samples of finished products collected from the marketplace.\nWe perform due diligence to ensure that product and ingredient safety and quality standards are maintained in the more than 200 countries and territories where our products are\nsold. We regularly assess the relevance of our requirements and standards and continually work to improve and refine them across our entire supply chain.\nEnvironmentalandSocialMatters\nAs investors and stakeholders increasingly focus on ESG issues, our Company and companies across all industries are facing challenges and risks related to, among other\nthings, environmental stewardship; social responsibility; diversity, equity and inclusion; and workplace rights. Where these challenges and risks relate to our business, we\nacknowledge that we have a role to play in developing and implementing solutions related to these important challenges. We have established specific ESG goals related to\nwater quality and scarcity; packaging materials used for our products; reduction of added sugar in our beverages; reduction of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas\nemissions; sustainable agriculture; diversity, equity and inclusion; and human and workplace rights. Our ability to achieve our ESG goals is dependent on many factors,\nincluding, but not limited to, our actions along with the actions of various stakeholders, such as our bottling partners, suppliers, governments, nongovernmental organizations,\ncommunities, and other third parties, all of which are outside of our control.\nSee “Item 1A. Risk Factors\"? in Part I of this report for additional information about risks and uncertainties facing our Company.",

As a result, we are subject to various U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations relating to personal data. These\nlaws have been subject to frequent changes, and new legislation in this area may be enacted in other jurisdictions at any time. These laws impose operational requirements for\ncompanies receiving or processing personal data, and many provide for significant penalties for noncompliance. Some laws and regulations also impose obligations regarding\ncross-border data transfers of personal data. These requirements with respect to personal data have subjected and may continue in the future to subject the Company to, among\nother things, additional costs and expenses and have required and may in the future require costly changes to our business practices and information security systems, policies,\nprocedures and practices. In addition, some countries are considering or have enacted data localization laws requiring that certain data in their country be maintained, stored\nand/or processed in their country. Maintaining local data centers in individual countries could increase our operating costs\nsignificantly. Our security controls over personal data, the training of employees and vendors on data privacy and data security, and the policies, procedures and practices we\nimplemented or may implement in the future may not prevent the improper disclosure of personal data by us or the third-party service providers and vendors whose technology,\nsystems and services we use in connection with the receipt, storage and transmission of personal data. Unauthorized access to or improper disclosure of personal data in\nviolation of personal data protection or privacy laws could harm our reputation, cause loss of consumer confidence, subject us to regulatory enforcement actions (including\npenalties, fines and investigations), and result in private litigation against us, which could result in loss of revenue, increased costs, liability for monetary damages, fines and/or\ncriminal prosecution, all of which could negatively affect our business and operating results. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, expenses to comply with privacy and\ndata protection standards and protocols imposed by law, regulation, industry standards and contractual obligations. Increased regulation of data collection, use, and retention\npractices, including self-regulation and industry standards, changes in existing laws and regulations, enactment of new laws and regulations, increased enforcement activity, and\nchanges in interpretation of laws, could increase our cost of compliance and operation, limit our ability to grow our business or otherwise harm our business.\nRISKSRELATEDTOENVIRONMENTALANDSOCIALFACTORS\nOur ability to achieve our environmental, social and governance goals are subject to risks, many of which are outside of our control, and our reputation and brands could\nbeharmed ifwefailtomeet suchgoals.\nCompanies across all industries are facing increasing scrutiny from stakeholders related to environmental, social and governance (*EsG\") matters, including practices and\ndisclosures related to environmental stewardship; social responsibility; diversity, equity and inclusion; and workplace rights. Our ability to achieve our ESG goals and\nobjectives and to accurately and transparently report our progress presents numerous operational, financial, legal and other risks, and are dependent on the actions of our\nbottling partners, suppliers and other third parties, all of which are outside of our control. If we are unable to meet our ESG goals or evolving stakeholder expectations and\nindustry standards, or if we are perceived to have not responded appropriately to the growing concern for ESG issues, our reputation, and therefore our ability to sell products,\ncould be negatively impacted. In addition, in recent years, investor advocacy groups and certain institutional investors have placed increasing importance on ESG matters. If, as\na result of their assessment of our ESG practices, certain investors are unsatisfied with our actions or progress, they may reconsider their investment in our Company.\nAs the nature, scope and complexity of ESG reporting, diligence and disclosure requirements expand, we may have to undertake additional costs to control, assess and report on\nESG metrics. Any failure or perceived failure, whether or not valid, to pursue or fulfill our ESG goals, targets and objectives or to satisfy various ESG reporting standards\nwithin the timelines we announce, or at all, could increase the risk of litigation.\nIncreasing concerns about the environmental impact of plastic bottles and other packaging materials could result in reduced demand for our beverage products and\nincreasedproductionanddistributioncosts.\nThere are increasing concerns among consumers, governments and other stakeholders about the damaging impact of the accumulation of plastic bottles and other packaging\nmaterials in the environment, particularly in the world's waterways, lakes and oceans, as well as inefficient use of resources when packaging materials are not included in a\ncircular economy. We and our bottling partners sell certain of our beverage products in plastic bottles and use other packaging materials that, while largely recyclable, may not\nbe regularly recovered and recycled due to low economic value or lack of collection and recycling infrastructure. If we and our bottling partners do not, or are perceived not to,\nact responsibly to address plastic materials recoverability and recycling concerns, our corporate image and brand reputation could be damaged, which may cause some\nconsumers to reduce or discontinue consumption of some of our beverage products. In addition, from time to time we establish and publicly announce goals and commitments\nto reduce the Coca-Cola system's impact on the environment by increasing our use of recycled content in our packaging materials; increasing our use of packaging materials\nthat are made in part of plant-based renewable materials; expanding our use of reusable packaging (including refillable or returnable glass and plastic bottles, as well as\ndispensed and fountain delivery models where consumers use refillable containers for our beverages); participating in programs and initiatives to reclaim or recover plastic\nbottles and other packaging materials that are already in the environment; and taking other actions and participating in other programs and initiatives organized or sponsored by\nnongovernmental organizations and other groups. If we and our bottling partners fail to achieve or improperly report on our progress toward achieving our announced\nenvironmental goals and commitments, the resulting negative publicity could adversely affect consumer preference for our products. In addition, in response to environmental\nconcerns, governmental entities in the United States and in many other jurisdictions around the world have adopted, or are considering adopting, regulations and policies\ndesigned to mandate or encourage plastic packaging waste reduction and an increase in recycling rates and/or recycled content minimums, or, in some cases, restrict or even\nprohibit the use of certain plastic containers or packaging materials. These regulations and policies, whatever their scope or form, could increase the cost of our beverage\nproducts or otherwise put the Company at a competitive disadvantage. In addition, our increased focus on reducing plastic containers and other packaging materials waste may\nrequire us or our bottling partners to incur additional expenses and to increase our capital expenditures. A reduction in consumer demand for our products and/or an increase in\ncosts and expenditures relating to production and\ndistribution as a result of these environmental concerns regarding plastic bottles and other packaging materials could have an adverse effect on our business and results of\noperations.\nWater scarcity and poor quality could negatively impact the Coca-Cola system's costs and capacity.\nWater is a main ingredient in substantially all of our products, is vital to the production of the agricultural ingredients on which our business relies and is needed in our\nmanufacturing process. It also is critical to the prosperity of the communities we serve and the ecosystems in which we operate. Water is a limited resource in many parts of the\nworld, facing unprecedented challenges from overexploitation, increasing demand for food and other consumer and industrial products whose manufacturing processes require\nwater, increasing pollution and emerging awareness of potential contaminants, poor management, lack of physical or financial access to water, sociopolitical tensions due to\nlack of public infrastructure in certain areas of the world and the effects of climate change. As the demand for water continues to increase around the world, and as water\nbecomes scarcer and the quality of available water deteriorates, the Coca-Cola system may incur higher costs or face capacity constraints and the possibility of reputational\ndamage, which could adversely affect our profitability.\nIncreased demand for food products and decreased agricultural productivity may negatively affect our business.\nAs part of the manufacture of our beverage products, we and our bottling partners use a number of key ingredients that are derived from agricultural commodities such as\nsugarcane, corn, sugar beets, citrus, coffee and tea. Increased demand for food products; decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions of the world as a result of\nchanging weather patterns; increased agricultural regulations; and other factors have in the past, and may in the future, limit the availability and/or increase the cost of such\nagricultural commodities and could impact the food security of communities around the world. If we are unable to implement programs focused on economic opportunity and\nenvironmental sustainability to address these agricultural challenges and fail to make a strategic impact on food security through joint efforts with bottlers, farmers,\ncommunities, suppliers and key partners, as well as through our increased and continued investment in sustainable agriculture, our ability to source raw materials for use in our\nmanufacturing processes and the affordability of our products and ultimately our business and results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nClimate change and legal or regulatory responses thereto may have a long-term adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nThere is increasing concern that a gradual increase in global average temperatures due to increased concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the\natmosphere will cause significant changes in weather patterns around the globe and an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters. Decreased agricultural\nproductivity in certain regions of the world as a result of changing weather patterns may limit the availability or increase the cost of key agricultural commodities, such as\nsugarcane, corn, sugar beets, citrus, coffee and tea, which are important sources of ingredients for our products, and could impact the food security of communities around the\nworld. Climate change may also exacerbate water scarcity and cause a further deterioration of water quality in affected regions, which could limit water availability for the\nCoca-Cola system’s bottling operations. Increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions could also impair production capabilities, disrupt our supply chain or\nimpact demand for our products. Increasing concern over climate change also may result in additional legal or regulatory requirements designed to reduce or mitigate the\neffects of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions on the environment. Increased energy or compliance costs and expenses due to increased legal or regulatory\nrequirements may cause disruptions in, or an increase in the costs associated with, the manufacturing and distribution of our beverage products. The effects of climate change\nand legal or regulatory initiatives to address climate change could have a long-term adverse impact on our business and results of operations. In addition, from time to time we\nestablish and publicly announce goals and commitments to reduce the Coca-Cola system’s carbon footprint by increasing our use of recycled packaging materials, expanding\nour renewable energy usage, and participating in environmental and sustainability programs and initiatives organized or sponsored by nongovernmental organizations and other\ngroups to reduce greenhouse gas emissions industrywide. If we and our bottling partners fail to achieve or improperly report on our progress toward achieving our carbon\nfootprint reduction goals and commitments, the resulting negative publicity could adversely affect consumer preference for our beverage products.",

Our recovery has been asynchronous and the full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will affect our results of operations,\nfinancial condition and cash flows will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including, among others, new information which may\nemerge concerning the pandemic, vaccine adoption rates (including boosters) and the effectiveness of vaccines in limiting or stopping the spread of COVID-19, either over the\nlong term or against new, emerging variants of COVID-19, and any related actions by governments.\nThe extent and nature of government actions related to the COVID-19 pandemic varied throughout 2020 and 2021 based upon the then-current extent and severity of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic within the respective markets. At times we experienced a decrease in sales of certain of our products in markets around the world, including consumer\ndemand shifting to more at-home consumption versus away-from-home consumption. While in 2021 we have experienced improved trends in away-from-home channels and\nimproved margins, if COVID-19 infection rates increase, the pandemic intensifies or expands geographically, or continued efforts to curb the pandemic are ineffective, the\nnegative impacts of the pandemic on our sales could be more prolonged and may become more severe than we are currently experiencing. In addition, continuing economic and\npolitical uncertainties, such as increased unemployment, decreases in disposable income, declines in consumer confidence, or economic slowdowns or recessions in any of our\nmajor markets, may slow down or prevent the recovery of the demand for our products or may erode such demand.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted and could continue to disrupt our global supply chain. We and our bottling partners have experienced temporary disruptions in certain\nof our operations; delays in delivery of concentrates, ingredients, packaging and equipment; temporary plant closures; production slowdowns; and difficulty or delays in\nsourcing key ingredients and beverage containers. We and our bottling partners may face similar disruptions in the future, which may increase supply chain and packaging\ncosts, or may result in an inability to secure key ingredients and inputs, which could cause delays in delivering our products to our customers and consumers. Although we are\nunable to predict the impact on our ability to source materials in the future, we expect supply chain pressures to continue into 2022.\nIn addition to the above risks, the COVID-19 pandemic may exacerbate other risks related to our business, including risks related to changes in the retail landscape or the loss\nof key retail or foodservice customers; fluctuations in input costs, inflation rates, and foreign currency exchange rates; and the ability of third-party service providers and\nbusiness partners to fulfil their\nrespective commitments and responsibilities to us in a timely manner and in accordance with the agreed-upon terms. The continuing evolution of the pandemic may also\npresent risks not currently known to us.\nIncreasedcompetitioncouldhurtourbusiness.\nWe operate in the highly competitive commercial beverage industry. For additional information regarding the competitive environment in which we operate, including the\nnames of certain of our significant competitors, refer to the heading “Competition”? set forth in Part I, “Item 1. Busines”? of this report. Our ability to maintain or gain share of\nsales in the global market or in local markets may be limited as a result of actions by competitors. Competitive pressures may cause the Company and our bottling partners to\nreduce prices we charge customers or may restrict our and our bottlers? ability to increase prices, as may be necessary in response to commodity and other cost increases. Such\npressures may also increase marketing costs along with in-store placement and slotting fees. In addition, the rapid growth of e-commerce may create additional consumer price\ndeflation by, among other things, facilitating comparison shopping, and could potentially threaten the value of some of our legacy route-tomarket strategies and thus negatively\naffect revenues. If we do not continuously strengthen our capabilities in marketing and innovation to maintain consumer interest, brand loyalty and market share while we\nselectively expand into other profitable categories in the commercial beverage industry, our business could be negatively affected.\nIf we are not successful in our innovation activities, our financial results may be negatively affected.\nAchieving our business growth objectives depends in part on our ability to evolve and improve our existing beverage products through innovation and to successfully develop,\nintroduce and market new beverage products. The success of our innovation activities depends on our ability to correctly anticipate customer and consumer acceptance and\ntrends; obtain, maintain and enforce necessary intellectual property protections; and avoid infringing on the intellectual property rights of others. If we are not successful in our\ninnovation activities, we may not be able to achieve our growth objectives, which may have a negative impact on our financial results.\nChanges in the retail landscape or the loss of key retail or foodservice customers could adversely affect our financial results.\nOur industry is being affected by the trend toward consolidation in, and the blurring of the lines between, retail channels, particularly in Europe and the United States. Larger\nretailers may seek lower prices from us and our bottling partners, may demand increased marketing or promotional expenditures, and may be more likely to use their\ndistribution networks to introduce and develop private-label brands, any of which could negatively affect the Coca-Cola system's profitability. In addition, in developed markets\ndiscounters and value stores are growing at a rapid pace, while in emerging and developing markets modern trade is growing at a faster pace than traditional trade outlets. Our\nindustry is also being affected by the rapid growth in sales through e-commerce retailers, e-commerce websites, mobile commerce applications and subscription services, which\nmay result in a shift away from physical retail operations to digital channels. As we and our bottling partners build e-commerce capabilities, we may not be able to develop and\nmaintain successful relationships with existing and new e-commerce retailers without experiencing a deterioration of our relationships with key customers operating physical\nretail channels. If we are unable to successfully adapt to the rapidly changing retail landscape, including the rapid growth in digital commerce, our share of sales, volume\ngrowth and overallfinancial results could be negatively affected. In addition, our success depends in part on our ability to maintain good relationships with key retail and\nfoodservice customers. The loss of one or more of our key retail or foodservice customers could have an adverse effect on our financial performance.\nIf we are unable to expand our operations in emerging and developing markets, our growth rate could be negatively affected.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to grow our business in emerging and developing markets, which in turn depends on economic and political conditions in those\nmarkets and on our ability to work with local bottlers to make necesary infrastructure enhancements to production facilities, distribution networks, sales equipment and\ntechnology. Additionally, we rely on local availability of talented management and employees to establish and manage our operations in these markets. Scarcity of, or heavy\ncompetition for, talented employee resources could impede our abilities in such markets. Moreover, the supply of our products in emerging and developing markets must match\nconsumer demand for those products. Due to product price limited purchasing power and cultural differences, our products may not be accepted in any particular emerging or\ndevelopingmarket.\nIf we do not successfully manage the possible negative consequences of our productivity initiatives, our business operations could be adversely affected.\nWe believe that improved productivity is essential to achieving our long-term growth objectives and, therefore, a leading priority of our Company is to design and implement\nthe most effective and efficient business model possible. Consequently, we continuously search for productivity opportunities in our business. Some of the actions we may take\nfrom time to time in pursuing these opportunities may become a distraction for our managers and employees and may disrupt our ongoing business operations; cause\ndeterioration in employee morale which may make it more difficult for us to retain or attract qualified managers and employees; disrupt or weaken the internal control\nstructures of the affected business operations; and give rise to\nnegative publicity which could affect our corporate reputation. If we are unable to successfully manage the possible negative consequences of our productivity initiatives, oun\nbusiness operations could be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to attract or retain a highly skilled and diverse workforce, our business could be negatively affected.\nThe success of our business depends on our Company's and the Coca-Cola system’s ability to attract, hire, develop, motivate and retain a highly skilled and diverse workforce\nas well as on our success in nurturing a culture that supports our growth and aligns employees around the Company's purpose and work that matters most. Competition and\ncompensation expectations for existing and prospective personnel have increased. In addition, the broader labor market is experiencing a shortage of qualified workers which\nhas further increased the competition we face for qualified employees. We may not be able to successfully compete for, attract or retain the highly skilled and diverse workforce\nthat we want and that our future business needs may require, such as employees with e-commerce, social media and digital marketing and advertising skills, and/or digital and\nanalytics capabilities. Changes in immigration laws and policies could also make it more difficult for us to recruit or relocate highly skilled technical, professional and\nmanagement personnel to meet our business needs. In addition, the unexpected loss of experienced and highly skilled employees due to an increase in aggressive recruiting for\nbest-in-class talent could deplete our institutional knowledge base and erode our competitiveness. Failure to atract, hire, develop, motivate and retain highly skilled and diverse\ntalent; to meet our goals related to fostering an inclusive and diverse culture, including increasing the number of underrepresented employees in the United States to develop\nand implement an adequate succession plan for our management team; to maintain a corporate culture that fosters innovation, collaboration and inclusion; or to design and\nsuccessfully implement flexible work models that meet the expectations of employees and prospective employees could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business\nand our future success.\nIncreases in the cost, disruption of supply or shortages of energy or fuel could affect our profitability.\nOur consolidated bottling operations operate a large fleet of trucks and other motor vehicles to distribute and deliver\nbeverage products to customers. In addition, we use a significant amount of electricity, natural gas and other energy sources to operate our production plants and the bottling\nplants and distribution facilities operated by our consolidated bottling operations. An increase in the price, disruption of supply or shortage of fuel and other energy sources in\ncountries where we have production plants, or in markets where our consolidated bottling operations operate, which may be caused by increasing demand, by events such as\nnatural disasters, power outages and extreme weather, or by government regulations, taxes, policies or programs designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to address\nclimate change, could increase our operating costs and negatively impact our profitability. Our independent bottling partners also operate large fleets of trucks and other motor\nvehicles to distribute and deliver beverage products to their own customers and use a significant amount of electricity, natural gas and other energy sources to operate their own\nbottling plants and distribution facilities. An increase in the price, disruption of supply or shortage of fuel and other energy sources in any of the major markets in which our\nindependent bottling partners operate could increase the affected independent bottling partners? operating costs and thus could indirectly negatively impact our results of\noperations.\nIncreases in the cost, disruption of supply or shortages of ingredients, other raw materials, packaging materials, aluminum cans and other containers could harm our",
