We have annotated, at an intra-sentential level, a corpus of sentences extracted from documents repre-sentative of ﬁnancial analysts’ most-read mate-rials by considering how ﬁnancial actors com-municate about the evolution of event trends and analyze related publications (news, ofﬁ-cial communications, etc.). Since we focus on identifying the expressions of opinions related to the economy and ﬁnancial markets, we an-notated the sentences that contain at least one subjective expression about a domain-speciﬁc term.\nCandidate sentences for annotations were randomly chosen from texts of special-ized press and professional information chan-nels over a period ranging from 1986 to 2021.\nOur annotation scheme relies on various lin-guistic markers like domain-speciﬁc vocabu-lary, syntactic structures, and rhetorical rela-tions to explicitly describe the author’s sub-jective stance. We investigated and evaluated the recourse to automatic pre-annotation with existing natural language processing technolo-gies to alleviate the annotation workload. Our aim is to propose a corpus usable on the one hand as training material for the automatic de-tection of the opinions expressed on an exten-sive range of domain-speciﬁc aspects and on the other hand as a gold standard for evalua-tion TBOA.\nIn this paper, we present our pre-annotation models and evaluations of their performance, introduce our annotation scheme and report on the main characteristics of our corpus.\n1 Introduction Financial markets are places where the exchange and the processing of information are crucial in determining prices. Thus, the knowledge about the market participants’ opinions is an essential driver of markets. Understanding how these opinions evolve is therefore valuable for ﬁnancial partici-pants and regulators.\nThe interaction of market participants deter-mines market dynamics, and how market partic-ipants act is largely determined by their beliefs on the outlook. The importance of beliefs in shap-ing market dynamics reﬂects an element of a self-fulﬁlling prophecy: beliefs guide decisions that then validate the underlying belief. One of the clas-sic models of this socio-psychological phenomenon is the Diamond and Dybvig’s model (1983) about bank runs.\nThe model demonstrates that even healthy b"

This paper employs the quantile regression method to determine the effect of regional factors on GCC markets during different market states, enabling a more detailed investigation of the structure and degree of dependence. Regional stock market returns and regional political risk are used to study the effect of regional factors. The findings of this study reveal that the reaction of market returns to regional factors is heterogeneous across the conditional distribution of the GCC's stock returns. More specifically, the results demonstrate that changes in regional factors, with respect to Islamic and conventional markets, have asymmetric effects on stock returns in the majority of the GCC markets. Except in Qatar, the regional geopolitical risk negatively affects the GCC's Islamic stock returns during bearish markets. Results for conventional stock returns have the same negative effect, yet only in extreme market states. As for the impact of the regional stock market, we find that the regional Islamic index has a positive impact across almost all quantiles with a stronger effect during bullish markets, except in Bahrain and Oman. As for conventional markets, we observe the same impact throughout the GCC except for in Saudi Arabia. Islamic and conventional markets' responses to changes in regional factors have similar behavior. Therefore, we conclude that, despite fundamental differences, Islamic and conventional stock markets in the GCC perform comparably, implying that a potential portfolio diversification benefit is not achieved except in limited cases.\n\n\n\n## Keywords\n\nGeopolitical risk\n\nGCC\n\nQuantile regression\n\nRegional factors\n\nStock return\n\n## JEL classification\n\nC21\n\n"
