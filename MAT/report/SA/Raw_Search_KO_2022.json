We are keeping consumers at the center of our innovation and marketing investments, while also leveraging our expertise in revenue growth management and execution.

For the full year, net revenues grew 11% to $43.0 billion, and organic revenues (non-GAAP) grew 16%. This performance was driven by 11% growth in price/mix and 5% growth in concentrate sales.\n• Operating margin: For the quarter, operating margin, which included items impacting comparability, was 20.5% versus 17.7% in the prior year, while comparable operating margin (non-GAAP) was 22.7% versus 22.1% in the 1 prior year.

    "content": "> • Business: KO remains firmly entrenched in its core beverage moat, with growth in premium categories such as Zero Sugar, energy drinks, and functional waters.   \n>   \n>  • Financials: Revenue growth of approximately 4 to 5% CAGR, operating margins of 28 to 30%, and FCF of about $15 to $17 billion annually.\n\nRead the complete narrative. [...] KO’s recent momentum looks promising, with a 15% year-to-date share price return and a one-year total shareholder return of nearly 18.5%. Steady advances like these suggest growing investor confidence in Coca-Cola's position, supported by consistent, if unspectacular, financial growth over the last few quarters. [...] Coca-Cola (KO) stock draws steady attention in the market, with recent performance data showing a mild uptick. Investors tracking KO will notice gains of around 1% this week and nearly 4% over the past month.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Coca-Cola.",

The dataset consists of all the listed companies in the Euro area for the period from 2010 to 2021. By exploiting portfolio sorting strategies, the paper evaluates to what extent and for how long investor sentiment can affect stock returns. Moreover, it considers whether additional factors can affect the relationship between sentiment and returns, casting light on the asymmetric effect related to positive and negative news.\n\nThe findings are as follows. First, high (low) sentiment stocks exhibit high (low) returns on average. Second, the predictability of stock returns holds for at least three months. Third, the market is less efficient in relation to small capitalization stocks compared to big ones. Fourth, positive news is factored into the stock price more slowly than negative news.
