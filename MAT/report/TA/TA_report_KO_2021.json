  "market_regime": "The current price of $52.17 is +3.14% above the 20-day moving average (MA20) of $50.58, indicating a short-term upward trend. In the medium-term, the price is +5.27% above the 50-day moving average (MA50) of $49.56, reinforcing the upward momentum. Over the long-term, the price is +8.15% above the 200-day moving average (MA200) of $48.23, suggesting a strong bullish trend. The consistent positive distances across all moving averages indicate a robust upward market regime. However, the significant deviation from these averages, particularly the long-term MA, introduces a mean reversion risk as the price has moved substantially away from its structural support levels.",
  "indicator_tension_analysis": "The RSI(14) at 66.53 is approaching overbought territory, which aligns with the price being near the upper Bollinger Band of $53.82, suggesting strong upward momentum. This momentum is in alignment with the multi-period trend structure, where the price is above all moving averages (MA20, MA50, MA200), indicating a cohesive bullish configuration. There is no immediate tension between momentum indicators and trend structure, as both suggest continued upward pressure.",
  "dead_cat_vs_value": "The structural categorization leans towards a 'Value Entry Opportunity' as the price is above all key moving averages (MA20, MA50, MA200), indicating strong support and alignment with the upward trend. The absence of any significant bearish crossover signals and the proximity to the upper Bollinger Band suggest that the current price level is supported by the underlying trend structure.",
